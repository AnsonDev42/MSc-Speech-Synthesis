( c_books_test_0440 "That is the proper time." )
( c_books_test_0441 "We now return to the nursery." )
( c_books_test_0442 "Teddy, keep still. Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, Turn round, Nagaina." )
( c_books_test_0443 "Wendy, he said, don’t withdraw." )
( c_books_test_0444 "Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!" )
( c_books_test_0445 "I might have known that thou wouldst not forget me." )

( c_books_test_0450 "I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log." )
( c_books_test_0451 "He was above all that sort of thing." )
( c_books_test_0452 "I’m so sorry, said Wendy Moira Angela." )
( c_books_test_0453 "He heard something else instead." )
( c_books_test_0454 "The kites will see that I am naked." )
( c_books_test_0455 "He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it." )
( c_books_test_0456 "She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy." )
( c_books_test_0457 "For that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity." )
( c_books_test_0458 "I did it, he said, reflecting." )
( c_books_test_0459 "How long has it taken?" )
( c_books_test_0460 "Man! said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth." )
( c_books_test_0461 "Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs when we are men." )
( c_books_test_0462 "It was as if Peter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship." )
( c_books_test_0463 "She was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_." )
( c_books_test_0464 "Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in." )
( c_books_test_0465 "It is the man-cub who has lived too long." )
( c_books_test_0466 "Give him honor, my lords!" )
( c_books_test_0467 "She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother." )
( c_books_test_0468 "Ye will not kill him, because that is not my will." )
( c_books_test_0469 "Remember they are always like this to begin with." )
( c_books_test_0470 "Ye-es, he said, between his teeth." )
( c_books_test_0471 "Pirates! he cried." )
( c_books_test_0472 "But how long ago?" )
( c_books_test_0473 "Wait a little." )
( c_books_test_0474 "But she was never quite sure, you know." )
( c_books_test_0475 "The first twin came to Peter." )
( c_books_test_0476 "There’s none can save you now, missy, Mullins hissed jeeringly." )
( c_books_test_0477 "Phew! said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf’s cubs)." )
( c_books_test_0478 "Tink said that the shadow was in the big box." )
( c_books_test_0479 "Now we are talking just like men!" )
( c_books_test_0480 "Do you agree, my bullies? asked Hook." )
( c_books_test_0481 "Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change." )
( c_books_test_0482 "Good gracious, said Teddy’s mother, and that’s a wild creature!" )
( c_books_test_0483 "Rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself." )
( c_books_test_0484 "His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame." )
( c_books_test_0485 "The big man has gone for his gun!" )
( c_books_test_0486 "As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away." )
( c_books_test_0487 "This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland." )
( c_books_test_0488 "We dare not wait for thee." )
( c_books_test_0489 "Let us take the man-cub and go." )
( c_books_test_0490 "Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr." )
( c_books_test_0491 "begs to be excused! He thought Mrs." )
( c_books_test_0492 "She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation." )
( c_books_test_0493 "That’s what some of our horses do, and I don’t blame them." )
( c_books_test_0494 "That was worth a little bruise, said the brown bear tenderly." )
( c_books_test_0495 "Now will you tell? said Kotick, all out of breath." )
( c_books_test_0496 "Wendy’s servants! Yes, said Peter, and you also." )
( c_books_test_0497 "It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away." )
( c_books_test_0498 "Ahem! said Kotick." )
( c_books_test_0499 "It was then that Hook bit him." )
( c_books_test_0500 "The cub must be shown to the Pack." )
( c_books_test_0501 "It may be that I have stolen one of them." )
( c_books_test_0502 "True enough, said Billy." )
( c_books_test_0503 "Nonsense! he said." )
( c_books_test_0504 "For a moment after Mr. and Mrs." )
( c_books_test_0505 "Are you ready, Tinker Bell? he called out." )
( c_books_test_0506 "Smee, he said, this seat is hot. He jumped up." )

( c_books_test_0508 "Peter did not compete." )
( c_books_test_0509 "Look at me, said Bagheera." )
( c_books_test_0510 "Free People, he was my meat from the first." )
( c_books_test_0511 "Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted." )
( c_books_test_0512 "Captain, let go! he cried, writhing." )
( c_books_test_0513 "He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon." )
( c_books_test_0514 "As for their dancing, I have seen the place where--Bapree-bap!" )
( c_books_test_0515 "Let me go! she ordered him." )

( c_books_test_0517 "Tootles held up his hand." )
( c_books_test_0518 "Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle." )
( c_books_test_0519 "Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all That keep the Jungle Law!" )
( c_books_test_0520 "He is the worst of them all." )
( c_books_test_0521 "Give me permission to come with you, said Kaa." )
( c_books_test_0522 "There was no way of knowing, save by going down." )
( c_books_test_0523 "Don’t get any letters, he said contemptuously." )
( c_books_test_0524 "They are still and white." )
( c_books_test_0525 "Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill." )
( c_books_test_0526 "Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast?" )

( c_books_test_0537 "Darling does not blame us." )
( c_books_test_0538 "It must be sewn on, she said, just a little patronisingly." )
( c_books_test_0539 "I’m Wendy, she said agitatedly." )
( c_books_test_0540 "Instant obedience was the only safe thing." )
( c_books_test_0541 "If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him so?" )

( c_books_test_0574 "It was securely fastened." )
( c_books_test_0575 "Strike first and then give tongue." )
( c_books_test_0576 "No. It’s awfully puzzling, said Tootles, who knew the story by heart." )
( c_books_test_0577 "I think I knew them, said Michael rather doubtfully." )
( c_books_test_0578 "Oh, all right, he said at last, and gulped." )
