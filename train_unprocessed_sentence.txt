( c_books_train_0276 "But how have they reached it?" )
( c_books_train_0277 "Now, he said, I will go to men." )
( c_books_train_0278 "Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in." )
( c_books_train_0279 "Peter isn’t coming. Peter not coming!" )

( c_books_train_0461 "They are perfectly safe, aren’t they?" )
( c_books_train_0462 "I’m going to teach you now." )
( c_books_train_0463 "For a time he was afraid of being dropped." )
( c_books_train_0464 "They don’t want us to land, he explained." )
( c_books_train_0465 "Am I dying, Bagheera? No, Little Brother." )
( c_books_train_0466 "Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them." )
( c_books_train_0467 "Michael is an engine-driver." )

( c_books_train_0494 "She was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_." )
( c_books_train_0495 "Let him run with the Pack." )
( c_books_train_0496 "Phew! said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf’s cubs)." )
( c_books_train_0497 "I have at least paid for thy son’s life." )

( c_books_train_0504 "How exactly like a boy!" )
( c_books_train_0505 "But Wendy hesitated." )
( c_books_train_0506 "They knew it; but as their father’s sons they acquitted themselves." )
( c_books_train_0507 "Wake, oh, wake!" )
( c_books_train_0508 "This gave Peter an idea." )
( c_books_train_0509 "Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk? said Mowgli." )
( c_books_train_0510 "She is not very polite." )
( c_books_train_0511 "Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what comes." )
( c_books_train_0512 "The pity of the Monkey People! Baloo snorted." )

( c_books_train_0520 "She saw them, but she did not believe they were there." )
( c_books_train_0521 "See, he said, the arrow struck against this." )
( c_books_train_0522 "There should have been a fourth night-light." )
( c_books_train_0523 "Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all." )

( c_books_train_0525 "Bagheera has noticed us." )
( c_books_train_0526 "Rama is mad with rage." )
( c_books_train_0527 "They are without leaders." )
( c_books_train_0528 "Certainly not. He is not really our father, John answered." )
( c_books_train_0529 "He is there." )
( c_books_train_0530 "She was in a hurry to get her breakfast." )
( c_books_train_0531 "Hullo, he said." )

( c_books_train_0533 "Brother, I go to my lair--to die." )
( c_books_train_0534 "Everything was wrong." )
( c_books_train_0535 "How is she? inquired Peter." )
( c_books_train_0536 "No, give him to me." )
( c_books_train_0537 "He is the worst of them all." )
( c_books_train_0538 "They heard Peter crow." )
( c_books_train_0539 "Nonsense! he said." )
( c_books_train_0540 "He has slept with us." )
( c_books_train_0541 "It was his hour of triumph." )
( c_books_train_0542 "The difficulty is which one to choose." )
( c_books_train_0543 "Watch well, braves." )
( c_books_train_0544 "Surely you know what a kiss is? she asked, aghast." )
( c_books_train_0545 "Yes, she said, clutching them." )
( c_books_train_0546 "It is nothing." )
( c_books_train_0547 "Baloo has spoken in his behalf." )
( c_books_train_0548 "Ye-es, he said, between his teeth." )
( c_books_train_0549 "What is the use of running away?" )
( c_books_train_0550 "Then lam into the pirates. The fight was short and sharp." )
( c_books_train_0551 "They throw stones and talk child’s talk." )
( c_books_train_0552 "He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it." )
( c_books_train_0553 "Then he unbarred the window." )
( c_books_train_0554 "(Hit him, hit him!)" )
( c_books_train_0555 "Elephants are very strictly preserved by the Indian Government." )
( c_books_train_0556 "He did not know his own strength in the least." )

( c_books_train_0562 "Hah! said Kaa with a chuckle, he has friends everywhere, this manling." )
( c_books_train_0563 "They sang and danced in their night-gowns." )
( c_books_train_0564 "Captain, let go! he cried, writhing." )
( c_books_train_0565 "It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores." )
( c_books_train_0566 "It is quite like tidying up drawers." )
( c_books_train_0567 "What is it? said Baloo." )
( c_books_train_0568 "(Woe betide thee, Nag!)" )
( c_books_train_0569 "Would you send me to school? he inquired craftily." )
( c_books_train_0570 "I complain of Nibs, he cried promptly." )
( c_books_train_0571 "We are no more than servants." )
( c_books_train_0572 "It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom." )
( c_books_train_0573 "Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward." )
( c_books_train_0574 "Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh." )

( c_books_train_0576 "Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast a cool head." )
( c_books_train_0577 "I’m so sorry, said Wendy Moira Angela." )
( c_books_train_0578 "Nothing remained to do but to knock." )
( c_books_train_0579 "Will he find it tonight?" )
( c_books_train_0580 "You get laughed at by gun-bullocks." )
( c_books_train_0581 "Yes, he answered faintly." )

( c_books_train_0646 "He was a little boy, and she was grown up." )
( c_books_train_0647 "Another charge and they are fairly started." )
( c_books_train_0648 "Not for nothing are ye called the Free People." )
( c_books_train_0649 "Swiftly turn them!" )
( c_books_train_0650 "Let them breathe, Akela, he said, holding up his hand." )
( c_books_train_0651 "He tottered out, haggard." )
( c_books_train_0652 "Darling hurried with Nana out of ." )
( c_books_train_0653 "We are beginning to know Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0654 "But remember, Bagheera, he is very little. I will remember." )
( c_books_train_0655 "I can’t think of a thing, he said regretfully." )
( c_books_train_0656 "Where is the power that made your pride?" )
( c_books_train_0657 "But Liza was dense." )
( c_books_train_0658 "Indeed he is not." )
( c_books_train_0659 "Teddy, keep still. Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, Turn round, Nagaina." )
( c_books_train_0660 "What is there to be afraid of? said the priest." )
( c_books_train_0661 "The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged." )
( c_books_train_0662 "ho! said Mowgli." )
( c_books_train_0663 "I will go as fast as I can, he said anxiously." )
( c_books_train_0664 "Wendy, he said, don’t withdraw." )
( c_books_train_0665 "Of course he did not strike." )
( c_books_train_0666 "We must block that end." )
( c_books_train_0667 "He saw his men draw back from him." )
( c_books_train_0668 "The big man brought the bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces!" )
( c_books_train_0669 "But she was never quite sure, you know." )
( c_books_train_0670 "Darling quivered and went to the window." )
( c_books_train_0671 "Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!" )
( c_books_train_0672 "Don’t tackle your father, my son!" )
( c_books_train_0673 "He can climb as well as they can." )
( c_books_train_0674 "Tootles did not flinch." )
( c_books_train_0675 "Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal." )
( c_books_train_0676 "Strike first and then give tongue." )
( c_books_train_0677 "But Rikki did not know." )
( c_books_train_0678 "A bull paid ten years ago! the Pack snarled." )
( c_books_train_0679 "We must go, she said, almost brightly." )
( c_books_train_0680 "Is this mutiny? asked Hook more pleasantly than ever." )
( c_books_train_0681 "Again Hook’s genius surmounted difficulties." )
( c_books_train_0682 "Gray Brother, come to me!" )
( c_books_train_0683 "He is a handsome boy." )
( c_books_train_0684 "How naked, and--how bold! said Mother Wolf softly." )
( c_books_train_0685 "I wish I could show you our business." )
( c_books_train_0686 "Nothing escaped his eagle eyes." )
( c_books_train_0687 "John, John, Michael would cry, wake up!" )
( c_books_train_0688 "It’s too dark to see much." )
( c_books_train_0689 "Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter." )
( c_books_train_0690 "Where is the redskin? he demanded abruptly." )
( c_books_train_0691 "What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock?" )
( c_books_train_0692 "I suppose it comes to the same thing." )
( c_books_train_0693 "He may know something." )
( c_books_train_0694 "This is no time for chasing." )
( c_books_train_0695 "Of course he was on the floor already." )
( c_books_train_0696 "At that speed!" )
( c_books_train_0697 "Skylights will do." )
( c_books_train_0698 "Even these noises ceased." )
( c_books_train_0699 "Peter slept on." )
( c_books_train_0700 "And we are your children, cried the twins." )
( c_books_train_0701 "Ah, envy not Hook." )
( c_books_train_0702 "Gunga Pershad, ahaa!" )
( c_books_train_0703 "There’s one, replied the figure." )
( c_books_train_0704 "Wendy was quite puzzled." )
( c_books_train_0705 "Then he felt better." )
( c_books_train_0706 "See, Sahib, where Pudmini’s leg-iron cut the bark of that tree!" )
( c_books_train_0707 "They sat stone-still, and their faces were white." )
( c_books_train_0708 "That is all a man, said Bagheera to himself, lying down again." )
( c_books_train_0709 "In a horrid silence Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0710 "Remember that it grows in little pots." )
( c_books_train_0711 "Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs." )
( c_books_train_0712 "Darling tightened her grip." )
( c_books_train_0713 "Fearful and horrible, Billy!" )
( c_books_train_0714 "Oh dear, oh dear, sighed Wendy." )
( c_books_train_0715 "But what are those Master Words?" )
( c_books_train_0716 "Out with the light!" )
( c_books_train_0717 "You mustn’t move." )
( c_books_train_0718 "And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib!" )
( c_books_train_0719 "What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet? Bagheera grunted." )
( c_books_train_0720 "Mother! cried Michael." )
( c_books_train_0721 "No, it isn’t, he said." )
( c_books_train_0722 "Wah! said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy." )
( c_books_train_0723 "Who are you?" )
( c_books_train_0724 "Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him." )
( c_books_train_0725 "Darling must have done." )
( c_books_train_0726 "She was very busy, stitching." )
( c_books_train_0727 "We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle!" )
( c_books_train_0728 "Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0729 "Those camels have racketed through our lines again--the third time this week." )
( c_books_train_0730 "Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister." )
( c_books_train_0731 "You don’t hear her, do you? and they both listened." )
( c_books_train_0732 "Rikki-tikki licked his lips." )
( c_books_train_0733 "We are great." )
( c_books_train_0734 "Quick, Tootles, quick, she screamed." )
( c_books_train_0735 "Wait a little." )
( c_books_train_0736 "The Monkey-People, watching in the trees, considered his play most wonderful." )
( c_books_train_0737 "You eat eggs." )
( c_books_train_0738 "Are you shot? John whispered tremulously." )
( c_books_train_0739 "Hullo, Tink, cried the wondering boys." )
( c_books_train_0740 "John, he said, shuddering, it’s most beastly stuff." )
( c_books_train_0741 "Nobody really wants us." )
( c_books_train_0742 "When the children flew away, Mr." )
( c_books_train_0743 "That is all we are, lookers-on." )
( c_books_train_0744 "My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand." )
( c_books_train_0745 "He took it from her heart and faced his band." )
( c_books_train_0746 "She’s awfully fond of Wendy, he said to himself." )
( c_books_train_0747 "They are afraid." )
( c_books_train_0748 "Tiger! What of the hunting, hunter bold?" )
( c_books_train_0749 "I will get some. There speaks the man’s cub, said Bagheera proudly." )
( c_books_train_0750 "The door opened and a lady came out." )
( c_books_train_0751 "It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable." )
( c_books_train_0752 "His lip was curled with malicious triumph." )
( c_books_train_0753 "The jungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut." )
( c_books_train_0754 "The trouble is this, Kaa." )
( c_books_train_0755 "The monkeys scattered with cries of--Kaa!" )
( c_books_train_0756 "No one spoke except Slightly." )
( c_books_train_0757 "COME AWAY, COME AWAY!" )
( c_books_train_0758 "He could take his medicine." )
( c_books_train_0759 "Else why should he go hunting these wild devils?" )
( c_books_train_0760 "There was a woman aboard." )
( c_books_train_0761 "He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones." )
( c_books_train_0762 "This shows how real the island was." )
( c_books_train_0763 "The captain! said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise." )
( c_books_train_0764 "Roses, cried Peter sternly." )
( c_books_train_0765 "Then he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered." )
( c_books_train_0766 "_Mea culpa, mea culpa_. He had had a classical education." )
( c_books_train_0767 "Ay, that’s a kiss. Peter did not hear him." )
( c_books_train_0768 "You may be sure Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0769 "Give him his will, said Messua’s husband." )
( c_books_train_0770 "Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr." )
( c_books_train_0771 "And again and again he darted in and pricked." )
( c_books_train_0772 "We are free." )
( c_books_train_0773 "He whispered to Tink, It’s Wendy’s mother!" )
( c_books_train_0774 "Ay, ay, said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin." )
( c_books_train_0775 "Nana, it isn’t six o’clock yet." )
( c_books_train_0776 "Teddy shouted to the house: Oh, look here!" )
( c_books_train_0777 "Very good, he said." )
( c_books_train_0778 "Funny! said Peter gravely." )
( c_books_train_0779 "And so this is a man’s cub." )
( c_books_train_0780 "He often met it, but he always forgot it." )
( c_books_train_0781 "That is why he has only killed cattle." )
( c_books_train_0782 "Darling slipped his behind his back." )
( c_books_train_0783 "Bagheera followed in case of accidents." )
( c_books_train_0784 "For a young king cobra?" )
( c_books_train_0785 "For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger." )
( c_books_train_0786 "Who is Nag? said he." )
( c_books_train_0787 "Hullo, Wendy, good-bye, he said." )
( c_books_train_0788 "The moon sets, he said." )
( c_books_train_0789 "Good hunting! cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches." )
( c_books_train_0790 "The birds were flown." )
( c_books_train_0791 "Never, probably, had this simple man admired Hook so much." )
( c_books_train_0792 "Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur." )
( c_books_train_0793 "Make your salute to Toomai of the Elephants!" )
( c_books_train_0794 "By whom? said Mowgli." )
( c_books_train_0795 "Quiet, their mother admonished them." )
( c_books_train_0796 "Let us carry her down into the house, Curly suggested." )
( c_books_train_0797 "Mother! That’s John, she said." )
( c_books_train_0798 "It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock." )
( c_books_train_0799 "Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for you to-night." )
( c_books_train_0800 "Darling consulted Mr." )
( c_books_train_0801 "Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan." )
( c_books_train_0802 "It was because he was so terribly alone." )
( c_books_train_0803 "Of course Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0804 "John, what are— But Hook had found his voice again." )
( c_books_train_0805 "But he was far too proud for that." )
( c_books_train_0806 "Who comes with me to the Sea Cow’s tunnel?" )
( c_books_train_0807 "She sat up in bed, and was interested at once." )
( c_books_train_0808 "When thou hast seen the elephants dance." )
( c_books_train_0809 "They grow tired of the nuts they pick, and throw them down." )
( c_books_train_0810 "To Toomai of the Elephants." )
( c_books_train_0811 "They must be swimming back or flying, the boys concluded." )
( c_books_train_0812 "Only, another time do not meddle with my game." )
( c_books_train_0813 "He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance." )
( c_books_train_0814 "All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower." )
( c_books_train_0815 "Softly now, softly!" )
( c_books_train_0816 "If she had known she would not have snapped." )
( c_books_train_0817 "He shall become a great tracker." )
( c_books_train_0818 "Bullocks! he said." )
( c_books_train_0819 "It was Smee who tied her to the mast." )
( c_books_train_0820 "I would wake him first, and then kill him." )
( c_books_train_0821 " all this time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0822 "He is there." )
( c_books_train_0823 "They all whipped off their hats." )
( c_books_train_0824 "You are too late, he cried proudly, I have shot the Wendy." )
( c_books_train_0825 "John, however, had held up his hand first." )
( c_books_train_0826 "But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now." )
( c_books_train_0827 "That is not true." )
( c_books_train_0828 "Art thou hurt? said Baloo, hugging him softly." )
( c_books_train_0829 "Now we have him, Hook shouted." )
( c_books_train_0830 "I can suppose only that, like Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0831 "Of course Mrs." )
( c_books_train_0832 "For you will go to the rubbish heap with Nag." )
( c_books_train_0833 "I am sore." )
( c_books_train_0834 "If a lady, what would she be like?" )
( c_books_train_0835 "The real Hook was also in the water." )
( c_books_train_0836 "It made him quite helpless." )
( c_books_train_0837 "The others did not hear her." )
( c_books_train_0838 "Great King, he said at last in a husky whisper." )
( c_books_train_0839 "Run back, Messua." )
( c_books_train_0840 "But what was that?" )
( c_books_train_0841 "They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged." )
( c_books_train_0842 "Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution." )
( c_books_train_0843 "Nibs and John were first and second mate." )
( c_books_train_0844 "One of us at least needs food." )
( c_books_train_0845 "Answer, or I shall teach you again, roared Kotick." )
( c_books_train_0846 "He bared his breast." )
( c_books_train_0847 "Rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself." )
( c_books_train_0848 "Set her free, came the astonishing answer." )
( c_books_train_0849 "And then he called aloud: To the tank, Bagheera." )
( c_books_train_0850 "He steals the young monkeys in the night." )
( c_books_train_0851 "What of the quarry ye went to kill?" )
( c_books_train_0852 "It may be that I have stolen one of them." )
( c_books_train_0853 "It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away." )
( c_books_train_0854 "Turn and see." )
( c_books_train_0855 "There sat Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted." )
( c_books_train_0856 "Stop that row, Michael." )
( c_books_train_0857 "You are very wise, you plains people." )
( c_books_train_0858 "Oh dear no!" )
( c_books_train_0859 "They have no remembrance." )
( c_books_train_0860 "What of Cecco? demanded Noodler." )
( c_books_train_0861 "I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants." )
( c_books_train_0862 "He thought them very over-rated persons." )
( c_books_train_0863 "Down--hurry them down, Akela!" )
( c_books_train_0864 "Free People, he was my meat from the first." )
( c_books_train_0865 "What of it?" )
( c_books_train_0866 "What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept." )
( c_books_train_0867 "Arre! said two or three women together." )
( c_books_train_0868 "It is a sort of very sad seal National Anthem." )
( c_books_train_0869 "The whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold." )
( c_books_train_0870 "At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy." )
( c_books_train_0871 "He’s tickling under my chin, said Teddy." )
( c_books_train_0872 "The kites have come down to see it." )
( c_books_train_0873 "Then at last he spoke passionately." )
( c_books_train_0874 "Wake up! barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise." )
( c_books_train_0875 "He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard." )
( c_books_train_0876 "Look behind you! sang Darzee." )
( c_books_train_0877 "They never go far, he said with a chuckle." )
( c_books_train_0878 "Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo, Mowgli went on." )
( c_books_train_0879 "Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown." )
( c_books_train_0880 "The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds, he said quietly." )
( c_books_train_0881 "Unrip your plan, captain, he cried eagerly." )
( c_books_train_0882 "Nana also troubled him in another way." )
( c_books_train_0883 "Nagaina is dead!" )
( c_books_train_0884 "They are still and white." )
( c_books_train_0885 "This trick had been in his head all the time." )
( c_books_train_0886 "Mowgli, the Frog." )
( c_books_train_0887 "Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0888 "Isn’t there? No." )
( c_books_train_0889 "Give it to me, she said." )
( c_books_train_0890 "They all whipped off their caps." )
( c_books_train_0891 "The stillness of the mountain stream!" )
( c_books_train_0892 "We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run." )
( c_books_train_0893 "I would almost rather have no children at all, she said disdainfully." )
( c_books_train_0894 "Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr." )
( c_books_train_0895 "No, no! they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled." )
( c_books_train_0896 "The man’s cub--the man’s cub? he said." )
( c_books_train_0897 "Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all That keep the Jungle Law!" )
( c_books_train_0898 "The Red Flower? said Mowgli." )
( c_books_train_0899 "We of the jungle have no dealings with them." )
( c_books_train_0900 "Ha! said Mowgli, on his back." )
( c_books_train_0901 "I have tossed, and the lagoon has won." )
( c_books_train_0902 "He’s as dead as Jukes, said Hook shortly." )
( c_books_train_0903 "I met Tabaqui in the dawn." )
( c_books_train_0904 "Let us do what Peter wishes! cried the simple boys." )
( c_books_train_0905 "He was seeking bigger game." )
( c_books_train_0906 "Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches." )
( c_books_train_0907 "I am sure to catch you." )
( c_books_train_0908 "Stand over a little, there. Oh, beg your pardon, said the mule." )
( c_books_train_0909 "Darzee stopped with a little shout." )
( c_books_train_0910 "Peter did not compete." )
( c_books_train_0911 "Get your things, Peter, she cried, shaking." )
( c_books_train_0912 "And it was so in all the other islands that he visited." )
( c_books_train_0913 "Rikk-tck-tck! chuckled Rikki-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0914 "Let him think and be still." )
( c_books_train_0915 "A man’s cub." )
( c_books_train_0916 "Peter was in the cabin!" )
( c_books_train_0917 "The Wolves are a free people, said Father Wolf." )
( c_books_train_0918 "Why can’t you be sensible and settle your places quietly?" )
( c_books_train_0919 "Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King? John inquired." )
( c_books_train_0920 "Under the feet of Rama lies the Lame One!" )
( c_books_train_0921 "Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine, he cried." )
( c_books_train_0922 "We know now that no one had been hit." )
( c_books_train_0923 "Perhaps it was best not to know." )
( c_books_train_0924 "Why should not I eat birds? Behind you!" )
( c_books_train_0925 "Nibs bent over her and listened reverently." )
( c_books_train_0926 "Neither knew that the other was coming." )
( c_books_train_0927 "This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles." )
( c_books_train_0928 "All things made he--Shiva the Preserver." )
( c_books_train_0929 "Who are they? Wendy whispered, shuddering." )
( c_books_train_0930 "They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind." )
( c_books_train_0931 "And Mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes." )
( c_books_train_0932 "He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name." )
( c_books_train_0933 "I have never seen one." )
( c_books_train_0934 "Is that all? Yes, he said rather sharply." )
( c_books_train_0935 "Akela said nothing." )
( c_books_train_0936 "That’s the worst kind of cowardice, said the troop-horse." )
( c_books_train_0937 "Cut the herd in two, Akela." )
( c_books_train_0938 "Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter." )
( c_books_train_0939 "Then again he frowned." )
( c_books_train_0940 "This is no bird, he said in a scared voice." )
( c_books_train_0941 "I shall wait here till he comes." )
( c_books_train_0942 "I also have made a little promise." )
( c_books_train_0943 "Sleep and dream of the kill." )
( c_books_train_0944 "Keep it there, or I must go back--must go back to Kaa." )
( c_books_train_0945 "Why, we burned your boat. That’s her, at any rate." )
( c_books_train_0946 "Hullo, Peter, they said." )
( c_books_train_0947 "I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band." )
( c_books_train_0948 "Give him to me." )
( c_books_train_0949 "Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious." )
( c_books_train_0950 "Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill!" )
( c_books_train_0951 "Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa." )
( c_books_train_0952 "Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers! said Rikki-tikki angrily." )
( c_books_train_0953 "In two strides he reached the door." )
( c_books_train_0954 "Remember they are always like this to begin with." )
( c_books_train_0955 "Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them!" )
( c_books_train_0956 "I have seen it." )
( c_books_train_0957 "Why have I never been taken among the Monkey People?" )
( c_books_train_0958 "He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result." )
( c_books_train_0959 "What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true." )
( c_books_train_0960 "That’s what some of our horses do, and I don’t blame them." )
( c_books_train_0961 "Is that a man’s cub? said Mother Wolf." )
( c_books_train_0962 "’Ware Tinker Bell." )
( c_books_train_0963 "He is only one, and I want to mischief all the seven." )
( c_books_train_0964 "But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot talk." )
( c_books_train_0965 "Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana’s eyes." )
( c_books_train_0966 "Now the business is in thy hands, said Bagheera to Mowgli." )
( c_books_train_0967 "But it was not wolves he saw." )
( c_books_train_0968 "Perhaps he is ill, Michael said." )
( c_books_train_0969 "He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth." )
