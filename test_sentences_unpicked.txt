(c_books_test_0001 "Hullo, replied Andy amicably, though he had quite forgotten them." )
(c_books_test_0002 "Aha, the Andy barracks were good." )
(c_books_test_0003 "Neither knew that the other was coming." )
(c_books_test_0004 "They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Andy now." )
(c_books_test_0005 "See, he said, the arrow struck against this." )
(c_books_test_0006 "Sleep and dream of the kill." )
(c_books_test_0007 "Will he find it tonight?" )
(c_books_test_0008 "It sounds very foolish." )
(c_books_test_0009 "That comes of being afraid, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0010 "He could only stare, horrified." )
(c_books_test_0011 "And so young too!" )
(c_books_test_0012 "Nonsense! he said." )
(c_books_test_0013 "Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Andy, Andy went on." )
(c_books_test_0014 "And a good name too." )
(c_books_test_0015 "Darzee was very like a man in some ways." )
(c_books_test_0016 "Good! said Andy, staring round slowly." )
(c_books_test_0017 "Where is the manling? Andy, in a trap." )
(c_books_test_0018 "I met Andy in the dawn." )
(c_books_test_0019 "Peter slept on." )
(c_books_test_0020 "Keep very still, all you three!" )
(c_books_test_0021 "That is the proper time." )
(c_books_test_0022 "Oh, surely she must have been dreaming." )
(c_books_test_0023 "Keep it there, or I must go back must go back to Andy." )
(c_books_test_0024 "O man unfathomable." )
(c_books_test_0025 "What has a man to do with us?" )
(c_books_test_0026 "I am sure to catch you." )
(c_books_test_0027 "Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown." )
(c_books_test_0028 "Yes, I too was born among men." )
(c_books_test_0029 "We will come, said thousands of tired voices." )
(c_books_test_0030 "There are such a lot of them, he said." )
(c_books_test_0031 "No sooner did Andy remember it than he heard the ticking." )
(c_books_test_0032 "Mother! cried Andy." )
(c_books_test_0033 "They go on with their recollections." )
(c_books_test_0034 "Up and kill!" )
(c_books_test_0035 "Out and hunt with thy master." )
(c_books_test_0036 "Get your things, Andy, she cried, shaking." )
(c_books_test_0037 "What price for a snake's egg?" )
(c_books_test_0038 "It is the man-cub who has lived too long." )
(c_books_test_0039 "All the population was yelling and screaming Andy-eater!" )
(c_books_test_0040 "Yes, said Andy, without turning his head, chuckling a little." )
(c_books_test_0041 "George, Andy! she cried when she could speak; and Andy." )
(c_books_test_0042 "I must go and see Andy, he said." )
(c_books_test_0043 "Four, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0044 "And gayest of all was Andy." )
(c_books_test_0045 "Look well, O Andy." )
(c_books_test_0046 "Quick Andy, he whispered, close the window; bar it!" )
(c_books_test_0047 "She thought of showing it to Andy." )
(c_books_test_0048 "He knew her now." )
(c_books_test_0049 "Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Andy." )
(c_books_test_0050 "He sighs again, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0051 "But your mother gets letters? Andy't have a mother, he said." )
(c_books_test_0052 "What is it? he cried, shrinking." )
(c_books_test_0053 "Open those eyes, Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0054 "It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile." )
(c_books_test_0055 "She was one of the kind that likes to grow up." )
(c_books_test_0056 "John is not here now, she gasped." )
(c_books_test_0057 "But everywhere the Andy of the Andy told him the same things." )
(c_books_test_0058 "Give him the Andy of the Andy, Andy with tail feathers spread!" )
(c_books_test_0059 "If Andy's heart had been beating they would all have heard it." )
(c_books_test_0060 "The reason was so simple: I'm fond of her too." )
(c_books_test_0061 "Every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly." )
(c_books_test_0062 "Quick, bows and arrows! Andy but Andy popped down their trees." )
(c_books_test_0063 "Give it to me, she said." )
(c_books_test_0064 "Then everything was right." )
(c_books_test_0065 "If Andy was lovable, what was it that made him so?" )
(c_books_test_0066 "He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result." )
(c_books_test_0067 "Novelty was beckoning to them as usual." )
(c_books_test_0068 "But he had to tell her the truth." )
(c_books_test_0069 "The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better." )
(c_books_test_0070 "But he had no pity for her." )
(c_books_test_0071 "He has missed, said Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0072 "He had thought them out, and remembered only their bad points." )
(c_books_test_0073 "Peter was alone on the lagoon." )
(c_books_test_0074 "Now I have missed my kill." )
(c_books_test_0075 "Their way is not our way." )
(c_books_test_0076 "Are you ready, Andy Andy? he called out." )
(c_books_test_0077 "Then at last he stopped." )
(c_books_test_0078 "The gentleman's name, Andy continued, was Andy." )
(c_books_test_0079 "Assuredly I will keep him." )
(c_books_test_0080 "That is all a man, said Andy to himself, lying down again." )
(c_books_test_0081 "She is dead, he said uncomfortably." )
(c_books_test_0082 "What talk is this of choosing?" )
(c_books_test_0083 "See paragraph .C below." )
(c_books_test_0084 "Now, he said, I will go to men." )
(c_books_test_0085 "How naked, and how bold! said Andy Andy softly." )
(c_books_test_0086 "It was as if Andy's terrible oath had boarded the ship." )
(c_books_test_0087 "Sit still and think!" )
(c_books_test_0088 "One could mention many lovable traits in Andy." )
(c_books_test_0089 "Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs." )
(c_books_test_0090 "Let us now kill a pirate, to show Andy's method." )
(c_books_test_0091 "Watch well, braves." )
(c_books_test_0092 "The worst that can happen." )
(c_books_test_0093 "What of it?" )
(c_books_test_0094 "They stand on their feet as I do." )
(c_books_test_0095 "Nothing escaped his eagle eyes." )
(c_books_test_0096 "No. Andy? Andy. Andy? Andy. Andy? Andy! Andy answer rang out scornfully." )
(c_books_test_0097 "Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution." )
(c_books_test_0098 "Who are they? Andy whispered, shuddering." )
(c_books_test_0099 "The gaiety of those romps!" )
(c_books_test_0100 "But it was not wolves he saw." )
(c_books_test_0101 "This was telling, and Andy seized his chance." )
(c_books_test_0102 "The curve of the broken dome was above his head." )
(c_books_test_0103 "Now the business is in thy hands, said Andy to Andy." )
(c_books_test_0104 "Then he unbarred the window." )
(c_books_test_0105 "They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged." )
(c_books_test_0106 "Hullo, Andy, she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible." )
(c_books_test_0107 "Let him run with the Andy, and be entered with the others." )
(c_books_test_0108 "What does she say, Andy? Andy had to translate." )
(c_books_test_0109 "I met my mates in the morning (I'll never meet them more!" )
(c_books_test_0110 "Mael, mael, Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0111 "Darling and Andy returned." )
(c_books_test_0112 "Stareek! Andy swam back to Andy, leaving the gulls to scream." )
(c_books_test_0113 "What would Andy do? they cried simultaneously." )
(c_books_test_0114 "Why should not I eat birds? Andy you!" )
(c_books_test_0115 "Give me another season, he said." )
(c_books_test_0116 "Of this, as of almost everything else, Andy was quite unconscious." )
(c_books_test_0117 "This time it is because I am a wolf." )
(c_books_test_0118 "The kites have come down to see it." )
(c_books_test_0119 "Now such an experience had come that night to Andy." )
(c_books_test_0120 "No one else cared. Andy snuffled a little." )
(c_books_test_0121 "Never, probably, had this simple man admired Andy so much." )
(c_books_test_0122 "But Andy was dense." )
(c_books_test_0123 "John and Andy watched him." )
(c_books_test_0124 "I will get some. Andy speaks the man's cub, said Andy proudly." )
(c_books_test_0125 "He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon." )
(c_books_test_0126 "Under the feet of Andy lies the Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0127 "I have never seen one." )
(c_books_test_0128 "Wah! said Andy Andy, and his eyes were very heavy." )
(c_books_test_0129 "Tabaqui has told thee too. Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0130 "What would you call me if I join? Andy demanded." )
(c_books_test_0131 "Brother, I go to my lair to die." )
(c_books_test_0132 "Tiger! Andy of the hunting, hunter bold?" )
(c_books_test_0133 "A different treatment was accorded to Andy, who came last." )
(c_books_test_0134 "Nevertheless Andy's words had left no room for doubt." )
(c_books_test_0135 "Now don't interrupt, he would beg of her." )
(c_books_test_0136 "He is such a man-cub as never was, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0137 "That was the last time the girl Andy ever saw him." )
(c_books_test_0138 "Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened." )
(c_books_test_0139 "How is she? inquired Andy." )
(c_books_test_0140 "He is not Andy the Andy, to hang in the branches." )
(c_books_test_0141 "She sat up in bed, and was interested at once." )
(c_books_test_0142 "The jungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut." )
(c_books_test_0143 "The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys." )
(c_books_test_0144 "We have a big work in hand." )
(c_books_test_0145 "His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame." )
(c_books_test_0146 "The Andy Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0147 "They are, he snarled." )
(c_books_test_0148 "Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord." )
(c_books_test_0149 "The upper world had called him, but would give no help." )
(c_books_test_0150 "As the dawn was breaking the Andy belled Andy, twice and again!" )
(c_books_test_0151 "Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice." )
(c_books_test_0152 "And these elephants were not thinking of men that night." )
(c_books_test_0153 "It is Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0154 "I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!" )
(c_books_test_0155 "I want always to be a little boy and to have fun." )
(c_books_test_0156 "We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee the madness and run." )
(c_books_test_0157 "What sort of form was Andy himself showing?" )
(c_books_test_0158 "The others came closer to him." )
(c_books_test_0159 "Let us go to Andy. Andy will he do for us?" )
(c_books_test_0160 "Bad Andy, let me up!" )
(c_books_test_0161 "She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse." )
(c_books_test_0162 "The monkeys scattered with cries of Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0163 "The Andy Andy himself could not have cut them up worse." )
(c_books_test_0164 "I almost agree with her, Andy snapped." )
(c_books_test_0165 "Wolf Andy, ye have cast me out too." )
(c_books_test_0166 "What is the use of running away?" )
(c_books_test_0167 "I am sore." )
(c_books_test_0168 "But what are those Andy Andy?" )
(c_books_test_0169 "Ye can hear Andy Andy below in the thickets." )
(c_books_test_0170 "Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours." )
(c_books_test_0171 "Bill Andy dead! cried the startled pirates." )
(c_books_test_0172 "He has been lame in one foot from his birth." )
(c_books_test_0173 "What kind of adventure? he asked cautiously." )
(c_books_test_0174 "I'll bring it, and she was off before he could stop her." )
(c_books_test_0175 "Rama is mad with rage." )
(c_books_test_0176 "Karait struck out." )
(c_books_test_0177 "Where did the buffaloes kill him?" )
(c_books_test_0178 "The big ravine of the Andy." )
(c_books_test_0179 "Michael had nearly cried." )
(c_books_test_0180 "Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him." )
(c_books_test_0181 "Then we will march on smooth roads, and forget all this hunting." )
(c_books_test_0182 "Would you send me to school? he inquired craftily." )
(c_books_test_0183 "As I was saying, it wasn't Andy's fault." )
(c_books_test_0184 "Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him." )
(c_books_test_0185 "No more would they torture at the stake." )
(c_books_test_0186 "Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what comes." )
(c_books_test_0187 "The Andy Andy are angry." )
(c_books_test_0188 "John, what are Andy Andy had found his voice again." )
(c_books_test_0189 "That is what she did." )
(c_books_test_0190 "While she stitched a change came to the lagoon." )
(c_books_test_0191 "That fiend! Andy." )
(c_books_test_0192 "Are you ready, boys? Andy, ay, from various parts of the lagoon." )
(c_books_test_0193 "Ohe, little one." )
(c_books_test_0194 "What is the matter with you? cried Andy, suddenly afraid." )
(c_books_test_0195 "Is this mutiny? asked Andy more pleasantly than ever." )
(c_books_test_0196 "Baloo has spoken in his behalf." )
(c_books_test_0197 "Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she had seen." )
(c_books_test_0198 "Starkey, mind the boat." )
(c_books_test_0199 "What is the Andy of the Andy?" )
(c_books_test_0200 "Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way." )
(c_books_test_0201 "She's awfully fond of Andy, he said to himself." )
(c_books_test_0202 "His courage was almost appalling." )
(c_books_test_0203 "So she tricked him, Andy the Andy." )
(c_books_test_0204 "(Go on, go on, Andy Andy!)" )
(c_books_test_0205 "The hateful telling broke out again." )
(c_books_test_0206 "What did his crow sound like? Andy asked one evening." )
(c_books_test_0207 "He fell in a little heap." )
(c_books_test_0208 "If a lady, what would she be like?" )
(c_books_test_0209 "Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0210 "It was like this, Andy said, trying to imitate Andy's crow." )
(c_books_test_0211 "Not of bit of it." )
(c_books_test_0212 "Nibs bent over her and listened reverently." )
(c_books_test_0213 "We will not wake him, for his strength is very great." )
(c_books_test_0214 "They all whipped off their caps." )
(c_books_test_0215 "Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!" )
(c_books_test_0216 "I am a stranger in this part of the jungle." )
(c_books_test_0217 "What of Andy? demanded Andy." )
(c_books_test_0218 "It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores." )
(c_books_test_0219 "Pull, Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0220 "What a lesson!" )
(c_books_test_0221 "Then he took a great breath and crowed." )
(c_books_test_0222 "Only, another time do not meddle with my game." )
(c_books_test_0223 "James Andy, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell." )
(c_books_test_0224 "A few beasts hissed." )
(c_books_test_0225 "Darling said threateningly." )
(c_books_test_0226 "They flung themselves down on the sward, close to their underground home." )
(c_books_test_0227 "To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate Andy ." )
(c_books_test_0228 "A great white bird." )
(c_books_test_0229 "Now, whither went they with the cub? Andy jungle alone knows." )
(c_books_test_0230 "A brave heart and a courteous tongue, said he." )
(c_books_test_0231 "A snap too much and the bulls will charge." )
(c_books_test_0232 "Darling, when Andy came in with Andy's medicine." )
(c_books_test_0233 "The branches are not what they were when I was young." )
(c_books_test_0234 "But more distinct came the shrill voice of Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0235 "Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word." )
(c_books_test_0236 "Good gracious, said Andy's mother, and that's a wild creature!" )
(c_books_test_0237 "Break them up." )
(c_books_test_0238 "We are great." )
(c_books_test_0239 "Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change." )
(c_books_test_0240 "That man-thing is not to be envied." )
(c_books_test_0241 "Is that a man's cub? said Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0242 "I am Andy." )
(c_books_test_0243 "Hurrah, I am in a story, Andy. Andy." )
(c_books_test_0244 "But an iron claw gripped his shoulder." )
(c_books_test_0245 "It was Andy." )
(c_books_test_0246 "He had his position in the city to consider." )
(c_books_test_0247 "Darling slipped his behind his back." )
(c_books_test_0248 "Peter, however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people." )
(c_books_test_0249 "Child of the Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0250 "See, Andy, where Andy's leg-iron cut the bark of that tree!" )
(c_books_test_0251 "He felt he was a strong man again." )
(c_books_test_0252 "He will never eat my babies again. Andy that's true enough." )
(c_books_test_0253 "I don't like that, said Andy's mother." )
(c_books_test_0254 "Never while we can follow a trail, said the cubs." )
(c_books_test_0255 "Yes, she said, clutching them." )
(c_books_test_0256 "Ay, ay, Andy said, and he cut Andy Andy's cords." )
(c_books_test_0257 "Ay, ay, said Andy blithely, and he strode into the cabin." )
(c_books_test_0258 "Never! she cried, and bobbed." )
(c_books_test_0259 "All except the wolves that were burned with the Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0260 "It was Andy's cockiness." )
(c_books_test_0261 "Crediting them with a nobler feeling Andy melted." )
(c_books_test_0262 "Make your salute to Andy of the Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0263 "The big man brought the bang-stick, and Andy fell in two pieces!" )
(c_books_test_0264 "But he could not or would not say." )
(c_books_test_0265 "If only something would make a sound! he cried." )
(c_books_test_0266 "Now he understood the trampling." )
(c_books_test_0267 "Not now, Andy, Andy said darkly." )
(c_books_test_0268 "Why, we burned your boat. Andy's her, at any rate." )
(c_books_test_0269 "In two strides he reached the door." )
(c_books_test_0270 "I have seen Andy among the Andy-log." )
(c_books_test_0271 "Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Andy." )
(c_books_test_0272 "But where's Andy? said Andy-tikki, looking carefully round him." )
(c_books_test_0273 "Herding in Andy is one of the laziest things in the world." )
(c_books_test_0274 "His hand closed on the fatal draught." )
(c_books_test_0275 "Is there any news of game afoot?" )
(c_books_test_0276 "They bowed again, and Andy began to lose his temper." )
(c_books_test_0277 "Told you what? H'sh!" )
(c_books_test_0278 "They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands." )
(c_books_test_0279 "The rest were tars before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle." )
(c_books_test_0280 "I complain of Andy, he cried promptly." )
(c_books_test_0281 "I have at least paid for thy son's life." )
(c_books_test_0282 "No, by thunder! Andy cried." )
(c_books_test_0283 "Put back that pistol first, it said threateningly." )
(c_books_test_0284 "But he would never have shown fight." )
(c_books_test_0285 "Do not forget me!" )
(c_books_test_0286 "And there is my hook." )
(c_books_test_0287 "The whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold." )
(c_books_test_0288 "She is not very polite." )
(c_books_test_0289 "The awful thing was that Andy thought this funny." )
(c_books_test_0290 "Certainly this is dewanee, the madness." )
(c_books_test_0291 "Another charge and they are fairly started." )
(c_books_test_0292 "Listen to Andy." )
(c_books_test_0293 "Her mother had been questioning her." )
(c_books_test_0294 "You shouldn't say such things, Andy retorted." )
(c_books_test_0295 "Mind the post!" )
(c_books_test_0296 "Am I right? Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0297 "I won't open unless you speak, Andy cried." )
(c_books_test_0298 "Captain, let go! he cried, writhing." )
(c_books_test_0299 "But Andy's wife was wiser." )
(c_books_test_0300 "Here come I, and the bulls are behind." )
(c_books_test_0301 "It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away." )
(c_books_test_0302 "But above all he retained the passion for good form." )
(c_books_test_0303 "Now Andy understood." )
(c_books_test_0304 "Oh dear, oh dear, sighed Andy." )
(c_books_test_0305 "Ah, envy not Andy." )
(c_books_test_0306 "We of the jungle have no dealings with them." )
(c_books_test_0307 "When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace." )
(c_books_test_0308 "For the last the very last of the brood?" )
(c_books_test_0309 "I am ever so much more than twenty." )
(c_books_test_0310 "Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now." )
(c_books_test_0311 "What orders! panted Andy." )
(c_books_test_0312 "I have been as quick as I could, she panted." )
(c_books_test_0313 "What of the quarry ye went to kill?" )
(c_books_test_0314 "I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised." )
(c_books_test_0315 "Tootles held up his hand." )
(c_books_test_0316 "Then the clamor broke out again." )
(c_books_test_0317 "'Ware Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0318 "But she seemed satisfied." )
(c_books_test_0319 "We must go, she said, almost brightly." )
(c_books_test_0320 "But for the moment Andy was shocked." )
(c_books_test_0321 "Brother, he crops in the jungle still." )
(c_books_test_0322 "Wendy, he said, don't withdraw." )
(c_books_test_0323 "He was above all that sort of thing." )
(c_books_test_0324 "All was as still as salt." )
(c_books_test_0325 "Eyes that can see in the dark the dark!" )
(c_books_test_0326 "His sobs woke Andy, and she sat up in bed." )
(c_books_test_0327 "Again came that ringing crow, and Andy dropped in front of them." )
(c_books_test_0328 "It would not tire a wounded cow." )
(c_books_test_0329 "Am I dying, Andy? Andy, Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0330 "Let the Andy Andy show his strength." )
(c_books_test_0331 "Begins now the dance the Andy of the Andy of Andy." )
(c_books_test_0332 "Let them! he answered recklessly." )
(c_books_test_0333 "She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed." )
(c_books_test_0334 "Hook was not his true name." )
(c_books_test_0335 "The beach is disgracefully crowded this season." )
(c_books_test_0336 "Good hunting, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0337 "But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0338 "Wendy Andy Andy Andy, she replied with some satisfaction." )
(c_books_test_0339 "He felt his ego slipping from him." )
(c_books_test_0340 "It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree." )
(c_books_test_0341 "The best way will be to toss for it." )
(c_books_test_0342 "I did it, he said, reflecting." )
(c_books_test_0343 "Then Andy Andy roared: Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0344 "That is my message." )
(c_books_test_0345 "Don't tackle your father, my son!" )
(c_books_test_0346 "DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?" )
(c_books_test_0347 "I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth." )
(c_books_test_0348 "It will be worse than before she came, they cried." )
(c_books_test_0349 "Darling woke to share her bliss, and Andy came rushing in." )
(c_books_test_0350 "Of course her kennel was in the nursery." )
(c_books_test_0351 "But if I had been a weak man, he said." )
(c_books_test_0352 "Ay, that's a kiss. Andy did not hear him." )
(c_books_test_0353 "You must have seen old Andy polishing off a drove." )
(c_books_test_0354 "What are you bothering for?" )
(c_books_test_0355 "Swear. Andy all swore." )
(c_books_test_0356 "Then Andy went to the Andy, still laughing." )
(c_books_test_0357 "Head off that drove of four-year-olds." )
(c_books_test_0358 "Wendy was grown up." )
(c_books_test_0359 "Let us carry her down into the house, Andy suggested." )
(c_books_test_0360 "What is it? she asked, anxious about him at once." )
(c_books_test_0361 "Fearful and horrible, Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0362 "Certainly Andy had been dreaming." )
(c_books_test_0363 "Then he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered." )
(c_books_test_0364 "Drink deep, Andy Andy, for when wilt thou drink again?" )
(c_books_test_0365 "Bring in the whole world." )
(c_books_test_0366 "John and Andy raced, Andy getting a start." )
(c_books_test_0367 "But a man-thing in their hands is in no good luck." )
(c_books_test_0368 "He is taking his meal with the others." )
(c_books_test_0369 "It is to listen to the stories." )
(c_books_test_0370 "As so often before, but never again." )
(c_books_test_0371 "Where is the bull, Andy?" )
(c_books_test_0372 "The white seal is coming after us, cried Andy." )
(c_books_test_0373 "After that it followed her about everywhere." )
(c_books_test_0374 "Son of the big man that killed Andy, she hissed, stay still." )
(c_books_test_0375 "The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom." )
(c_books_test_0376 "The cub must be shown to the Andy." )
(c_books_test_0377 "A tree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him." )
(c_books_test_0378 "Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers! said Andy-tikki angrily." )
(c_books_test_0379 "This is the one mark that Andy has left on the Andy." )
(c_books_test_0380 "Children, I hear your father's step." )
(c_books_test_0381 "You don't think I would kill him while he was sleeping!" )
(c_books_test_0382 "There was a splash, and then silence." )
(c_books_test_0383 "It doesn't matter, Andy said." )
(c_books_test_0384 "She asked where he lived." )
(c_books_test_0385 "Not long ago." )
(c_books_test_0386 "No more sleeping in traps for me, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0387 "Gray Andy, come to me!" )
(c_books_test_0388 "He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery." )
(c_books_test_0389 "She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars." )
(c_books_test_0390 "I was born in the jungle." )
(c_books_test_0391 "That was the time for stories." )
(c_books_test_0392 "No, no, she cried." )
(c_books_test_0393 "He's as dead as Andy, said Andy shortly." )
(c_books_test_0394 "Augrh! said Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0395 "He is there." )
(c_books_test_0396 "Kala Andy took me, and I saw." )
(c_books_test_0397 "Darling signed him to go softly." )
(c_books_test_0398 "I have tossed, and the lagoon has won." )
(c_books_test_0399 "You need not be sorry for her." )
(c_books_test_0400 "Ho! said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0401 "Father knows best, she always said, whatever her private opinion must be." )
(c_books_test_0402 "That grows outside their huts in the twilight." )
(c_books_test_0403 "He will crush our young, said the cobras inside." )
(c_books_test_0404 "They may attack again. Andy will not move till I order them." )
(c_books_test_0405 "It was a black voice." )
(c_books_test_0406 "Very good, said the young seal carelessly." )
(c_books_test_0407 "Where is the redskin? he demanded abruptly." )
(c_books_test_0408 "It was cleverly done." )
(c_books_test_0409 "Let me run away." )
(c_books_test_0410 "Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Andy." )
(c_books_test_0411 "They thought they would soon be no more." )
(c_books_test_0412 "That was worth a little bruise, said the brown bear tenderly." )
(c_books_test_0413 "Don't flounce off like that." )
(c_books_test_0414 "He heard something else instead." )
(c_books_test_0415 "Round the bed-post!" )
(c_books_test_0416 "To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy." )
(c_books_test_0417 "He gave the pirate a hand to help him up." )
(c_books_test_0418 "Is that all? Andy, he said rather sharply." )
(c_books_test_0419 "Softly now, softly!" )
(c_books_test_0420 "Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill." )
(c_books_test_0421 "Of course the Andy vary a good deal." )
(c_books_test_0422 "Those camels have racketed through our lines again the third time this week." )
(c_books_test_0423 "Mowgli, hast thou anything to say? Andy." )
(c_books_test_0424 "It made him quite helpless." )
(c_books_test_0425 "What is it? said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0426 "But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now." )
(c_books_test_0427 "No, no, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0428 "Four boys caught him to prevent the thud." )
(c_books_test_0429 "How exactly like a boy!" )
(c_books_test_0430 "In the confusion some struck at their own side." )
(c_books_test_0431 "I hadn't really any hope, he said." )
(c_books_test_0432 "But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw." )
(c_books_test_0433 "There was very little talking at the Andy." )
(c_books_test_0434 "Why have I never been taken among the Andy Andy?" )
(c_books_test_0435 "Man! said Andy Andy, showing all his white teeth." )
(c_books_test_0436 "Darling would never forgive us." )
(c_books_test_0437 "It's too dark to see much." )
(c_books_test_0438 "All the jungle knows that I have killed Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0439 "For a young king cobra?" )
(c_books_test_0440 "It was his hour of triumph." )
(c_books_test_0441 "It was a marvellous imitation." )
(c_books_test_0442 "Your friends are making as much noise as ever." )
(c_books_test_0443 "Who is Andy? said he." )
(c_books_test_0444 "They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind." )
(c_books_test_0445 "Wendy rushed to the window." )
(c_books_test_0446 "Then the little children in the village made him very angry." )
(c_books_test_0447 "Man-cub they call me!" )
(c_books_test_0448 "The big man has gone for his gun!" )
(c_books_test_0449 "Listen, Andy Andy, he cried, I am your friend no more." )
(c_books_test_0450 "They have good reason, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0451 "What is it, Andy? she said." )
(c_books_test_0452 "Up, Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0453 "They are no longer there." )
(c_books_test_0454 "We shall see for whom she is looking presently." )
(c_books_test_0455 "This is no time for chasing." )
(c_books_test_0456 "Surely you know what a kiss is? she asked, aghast." )
(c_books_test_0457 "Your right is to kill me here on the Andy Andy, now." )
(c_books_test_0458 "Why, that was just what she wanted." )
(c_books_test_0459 "The elephant-folk are out tonight." )
(c_books_test_0460 "Nag is dead dong!" )
(c_books_test_0461 "Whatareyouquackingabout? and so on." )
(c_books_test_0462 "What's your name? he asked." )
(c_books_test_0463 "The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged." )
(c_books_test_0464 "Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate." )
(c_books_test_0465 "Hook was fighting now without hope." )
(c_books_test_0466 "Wendy quite liked it, until Andy pointed out the drawbacks." )
(c_books_test_0467 "Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind." )
(c_books_test_0468 "Free Andy, he was my meat from the first." )
(c_books_test_0469 "And I refuse, cried Andy." )
(c_books_test_0470 "Look at the marks on his arms and legs." )
(c_books_test_0471 "Remember mumps, he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again." )
(c_books_test_0472 "At that speed!" )
(c_books_test_0473 "Above all, he is always hungry, said Andy hopefully." )
(c_books_test_0474 "Tootles did not flinch." )
(c_books_test_0475 "Darling may not even offer Andy her mouth, and Andy." )
(c_books_test_0476 "You mustn't move." )
(c_books_test_0477 "They were such very bad dreams, said the camel." )
(c_books_test_0478 "He did more than wriggle." )
(c_books_test_0479 "But Andy did not know." )
(c_books_test_0480 "Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home!" )
(c_books_test_0481 "Who are you? Andy answer." )
(c_books_test_0482 "But Andy's plan was simple enough." )
(c_books_test_0483 "They don't want us to land, he explained." )
(c_books_test_0484 "Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!" )
(c_books_test_0485 "Nothing remained to do but to knock." )
(c_books_test_0486 "For the rest, Andy goes free to live as he pleases." )
(c_books_test_0487 "Wendy, let us go home, cried Andy and Andy together." )
(c_books_test_0488 "Look behind you! sang Andy." )
(c_books_test_0489 "That is not true." )
(c_books_test_0490 "Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked." )
(c_books_test_0491 "I speak for the man's cub." )
(c_books_test_0492 "He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings." )
(c_books_test_0493 "That is why he has only killed cattle." )
(c_books_test_0494 "They steeled Andy's heart." )
(c_books_test_0495 "Knives are dirty things at any time." )
(c_books_test_0496 "Hira Andy, Andy Andy, Andy Andy, ahaa!" )
(c_books_test_0497 "He can turn bullets." )
(c_books_test_0498 "It is well that this nonsense ends safely." )
(c_books_test_0499 "He can climb as well as they can." )
(c_books_test_0500 "The holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat staring stupidly." )
(c_books_test_0501 "Even these noises ceased." )
(c_books_test_0502 "But Andy and Andy had disappeared into the grass." )
(c_books_test_0503 "I am not ready yet." )
(c_books_test_0504 "Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them." )
(c_books_test_0505 "We had thought that thou wouldst know, Andy. I?" )
(c_books_test_0506 "I complain of Andy, said Andy instantly." )
(c_books_test_0507 "Always pecking at new things are the Andy-log." )
(c_books_test_0508 "I had never seen the jungle." )
(c_books_test_0509 "Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side." )
(c_books_test_0510 "He whispered to Andy, Andy's Andy's mother!" )
(c_books_test_0511 "But Andy whistled." )
(c_books_test_0512 "I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on." )
(c_books_test_0513 "Where is the haste that ye hurry by?" )
(c_books_test_0514 "True enough, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0515 "And all that time he never set flipper on dry ground." )
(c_books_test_0516 "He took it from her heart and faced his band." )
(c_books_test_0517 "Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Andy Andy!" )
(c_books_test_0518 "Slightly was the first to speak." )
(c_books_test_0519 "I would wake him first, and then kill him." )
(c_books_test_0520 "Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in." )
(c_books_test_0521 "Heavenly was Andy's word." )
(c_books_test_0522 "I will die without fighting." )
(c_books_test_0523 "Let him think and be still." )
(c_books_test_0524 "The pirates looked at each other." )
(c_books_test_0525 "Praise him with nightingale words  Andy, I will praise him instead." )
(c_books_test_0526 "To't again, he cried despairingly." )
(c_books_test_0527 "Hullo, Andy, good-bye, he said." )
(c_books_test_0528 "The moon sets, he said." )
(c_books_test_0529 "Contact the Andy as set forth in Andy  below." )
(c_books_test_0530 "Nearer! hissed Andy, and they all moved again." )
(c_books_test_0531 "Everything just as it should be, you see." )
(c_books_test_0532 "He is very old and very cunning." )
(c_books_test_0533 "I am sorry." )
(c_books_test_0534 "He was dead before the big man blew him in two." )
(c_books_test_0535 "He was already in his basket." )
(c_books_test_0536 "That's the worst kind of cowardice, said the troop-horse." )
(c_books_test_0537 "Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them!" )
(c_books_test_0538 "We will leave the cake on the shore of the Andy' Andy." )
(c_books_test_0539 "The cub can be bought for a price." )
(c_books_test_0540 "Run back, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0541 "I don't think he is a cypher, Andy cried instantly." )
(c_books_test_0542 "Up, dog! Andy cried." )
(c_books_test_0543 "Wake, oh, wake!" )
(c_books_test_0544 "There is my hand on it, they both said." )
(c_books_test_0545 "Have you been good form to-day? was their eternal question." )
(c_books_test_0546 "Let us talk, he said." )
(c_books_test_0547 "Bagheera, he shouted, I am here." )
(c_books_test_0548 "What was that? Andy they could see nothing." )
(c_books_test_0549 "I daresay it will hurt a little, she warned him." )
(c_books_test_0550 "I am just Andy, he said, and nobody minds me." )
(c_books_test_0551 "Darling tightened her grip." )
(c_books_test_0552 "His vitals were tortured by this problem." )
(c_books_test_0553 "Remember they are always like this to begin with." )
(c_books_test_0554 "It was then that Andy bit him." )
(c_books_test_0555 "It is the fairy language." )
(c_books_test_0556 "Rule Andy! squeaked Andy." )
(c_books_test_0557 "Do you really think he is old Andy come back?" )
(c_books_test_0558 "I can't think of a thing, he said regretfully." )
(c_books_test_0559 "The boy held the Andy Andy." )
(c_books_test_0560 "That was enough for Andy." )
(c_books_test_0561 "That is because I have killed Andy Andy, he said to himself." )
(c_books_test_0562 "How dare you?" )
(c_books_test_0563 "I feel a draught. O Andy, never ask me to do that." )
(c_books_test_0564 "Let him run with the Andy." )
(c_books_test_0565 "She lives, Andy said briefly." )
(c_books_test_0566 "You must, said the troop horse." )
(c_books_test_0567 "That is good, said the snake." )
(c_books_test_0568 "Who can trust the Andy-log?" )
(c_books_test_0569 "For the Andy, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0570 "Ye-es, he said, between his teeth." )
(c_books_test_0571 "Better still, talk not when thy elders speak. Andy rose to go." )
(c_books_test_0572 "You don't hear her, do you? and they both listened." )
(c_books_test_0573 "When ye are full-fed, the madness may come upon you again." )
(c_books_test_0574 "Don't touch him, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0575 "Will you come with me if I win? said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0576 "Grandly, however, did Andy respond." )
(c_books_test_0577 "I did them no harm, but they were afraid of me." )
(c_books_test_0578 "See, said Andy in answer to Andy's question, that is a mother." )
(c_books_test_0579 "Open the cabin door and drive them in." )
(c_books_test_0580 "Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings." )
(c_books_test_0581 "I think she said, Andy Andy,' he whispered." )
(c_books_test_0582 "For we have come to his last moment." )
(c_books_test_0583 "Thou art altogether right, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0584 "The man's cub the man's cub? he said." )
(c_books_test_0585 "Gunga Andy, ahaa!" )
(c_books_test_0586 "The child speaks truth, said he." )
(c_books_test_0587 "That is the awful thing, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0588 "Here, youngster, stop squealing." )
(c_books_test_0589 "Of course he was on the floor already." )
(c_books_test_0590 "He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance." )
(c_books_test_0591 "Lay your beast alongside, Andy, and let him prod with his tusks." )
(c_books_test_0592 "After all, he was the only man that the Andy-Cook had feared." )
(c_books_test_0593 "He is asleep." )
(c_books_test_0594 "I have just thought of a splendid joke." )
(c_books_test_0595 "I don't want ever to be a man, he said with passion." )
(c_books_test_0596 "Who comes with me to the Andy Andy's tunnel?" )
(c_books_test_0597 "It was one such day, and they were all on Andy' Andy." )
(c_books_test_0598 "Stand back, manling." )
(c_books_test_0599 "Pan, who and what art thou? he cried huskily." )
(c_books_test_0600 "Cut the herd in two, Andy." )
(c_books_test_0601 "Ha! said Andy, on his back." )
(c_books_test_0602 "What stayed him was Andy's impertinent appearance as he slept." )
(c_books_test_0603 "We must help their wandering memories." )
(c_books_test_0604 "Of course it's awfully fascinating! she cried." )
(c_books_test_0605 "Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter." )
(c_books_test_0606 "For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger." )
(c_books_test_0607 "Fool that I am!" )
(c_books_test_0608 "To kill a naked cub is shame." )
(c_books_test_0609 "Now, when Andy was killed, the big man had a stick." )
(c_books_test_0610 "Wendy was quite puzzled." )
(c_books_test_0611 "Not to-night? asked the lost boys bewildered." )
(c_books_test_0612 "This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles." )
(c_books_test_0613 "What was that? cried Andy." )
(c_books_test_0614 "There's none can save you now, missy, Andy hissed jeeringly." )
(c_books_test_0615 "The birds were flown." )
(c_books_test_0616 "Peter's first words tell all." )
(c_books_test_0617 "Darling hurried with Andy out of ." )
(c_books_test_0618 "But the bullocks only clicked their horns together and went on chewing." )
(c_books_test_0619 "Now, reader, time what happened by your watch." )
(c_books_test_0620 "(Give him the tusk!)" )
(c_books_test_0621 "Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it." )
(c_books_test_0622 "Don't go, they called in pity." )
(c_books_test_0623 "Where shall I go?" )
(c_books_test_0624 "One! (Slightly had begun to count.)" )
(c_books_test_0625 "He does so need a mother, Andy said." )
(c_books_test_0626 "Messy style of feeding, that, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0627 "But there was the arrow." )
(c_books_test_0628 "(Here Andy-tikki interrupted, and the rest of the song is lost.)" )
(c_books_test_0629 "It is quite like tidying up drawers." )
(c_books_test_0630 "Mouths opened and remained open." )
(c_books_test_0631 "I did wrong." )
(c_books_test_0632 "Wilt thou still keep him, Andy? Andy him! she gasped." )
(c_books_test_0633 "Yes, yes, they answered eagerly." )
(c_books_test_0634 "Of course he did not strike." )
(c_books_test_0635 "Wah! Andy went on chewing." )
(c_books_test_0636 "I've no nursery to fight for, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0637 "But that is a story for grown-ups." )
(c_books_test_0638 "What is the matter? asked Andy-tikki." )
(c_books_test_0639 "One more wail would go the round in that wind by night." )
(c_books_test_0640 "We are free." )
(c_books_test_0641 "Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Andy." )
(c_books_test_0642 "Indeed he is not." )
(c_books_test_0643 "Ye will not forget me? said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0644 "Twice the iron hand clawed him." )
(c_books_test_0645 "Suddenly he tried the guessing game." )
(c_books_test_0646 "In a tremble they opened the street door." )
(c_books_test_0647 "This was such an occasion." )
(c_books_test_0648 "Oh dear no!" )
(c_books_test_0649 "My name is Andy Andy, he told her." )
(c_books_test_0650 "Don't you envy our pranceful bands?" )
(c_books_test_0651 "It's all right, Andy announced, emerging from his hiding-place." )
(c_books_test_0652 "Give me permission to come with you, said Andy." )
(c_books_test_0653 "Look at your friends, Andy-tikki." )
