( c_books_train_0004 "I say, how do you do it? asked Andy, rubbing his knee." )
( c_books_train_0005 "When the children flew away, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0006 "She stood over them to let them have their sleep out." )
( c_books_train_0007 "They have therefore become very sure-footed." )
( c_books_train_0008 "It is only your carelessness in driving." )
( c_books_train_0009 "Bring master and missus home from the party!" )
( c_books_train_0010 "They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees." )
( c_books_train_0011 "Yes, he answered faintly." )
( c_books_train_0012 "Nag is everywhere, Andy-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0013 "I say, Andy, I see the smoke of the redskin camp! Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0014 "I, Andy Andy, did it." )
( c_books_train_0015 "Darling smelt the bowl." )
( c_books_train_0016 "Where is the power that made your pride?" )
( c_books_train_0017 "Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly." )
( c_books_train_0018 "The dinghy drifted away." )
( c_books_train_0019 "Petersen Andy is a madman." )
( c_books_train_0020 "That is a man." )
( c_books_train_0021 "And hide you, O Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0022 "He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him." )
( c_books_train_0023 "The black ants have come up to know it." )
( c_books_train_0024 "You know I don't mind that now, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0025 "Keep count! shouted Andy scornfully." )
( c_books_train_0026 "Do you think he is a cypher, Andy? Andy not." )
( c_books_train_0027 "I have no cloth to wrap me." )
( c_books_train_0028 "Have we been captained all this time by a codfish! they muttered." )
( c_books_train_0029 "Thus defenceless Andy found him." )
( c_books_train_0030 "She was very busy, stitching." )
( c_books_train_0031 "The Andy are a free people, said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0032 "Wait till you've rounded the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0033 "Fortunately she knew at once what to do." )
( c_books_train_0034 "But how have they reached it?" )

( c_books_train_0058 "They ought to have looked at Andy." )
( c_books_train_0059 "Man! he snapped." )

( c_books_train_0063 "Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed." )
( c_books_train_0064 "My mouth is bleeding." )
( c_books_train_0065 "No one ever gets over the first unfairness; no one except Andy." )
( c_books_train_0066 "No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0067 "They tucked the stuff into their mouths and chumped solemnly." )
( c_books_train_0068 "The kites will see that I am naked." )
( c_books_train_0069 "Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs when we are men." )
( c_books_train_0070 "While she slept she had a dream." )
( c_books_train_0071 "Isn't there? Andy." )
( c_books_train_0072 "I am a descendant. Andy are only children, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0073 "How beautiful are the noble children!" )
( c_books_train_0074 "They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Andy." )
( c_books_train_0075 "But I must try to return to my own jungle." )
( c_books_train_0076 "That's his way of making friends. Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0077 "Ah, said Andy Andy, I have waited here very many days." )
( c_books_train_0078 "Nobody coddles me." )
( c_books_train_0079 "That was what he meant." )
( c_books_train_0080 "Teddy, keep still. Andy Andy-tikki came up and cried, Andy round, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0081 "Smee, he said, this seat is hot. Andy jumped up." )
( c_books_train_0082 "Absolutely finished now, they thought." )
( c_books_train_0083 "Room for the leader of the Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0084 "It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night, said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0085 "You must be nice to him, Andy impressed on her brothers." )
( c_books_train_0086 "He thought he had attached the shadow himself." )
( c_books_train_0087 "Now, listen! cried Andy, and all listened." )
( c_books_train_0088 "Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly." )
( c_books_train_0089 "We dare not wait for thee." )
( c_books_train_0090 "Which side had won?" )
( c_books_train_0091 "It seems a shame to have neglected Andy." )
( c_books_train_0092 "They have no manners, these Andy Andy, said Andy to himself." )
( c_books_train_0093 "Whoof! said Andy, when he stood under the still trees again." )
( c_books_train_0094 "They were socially inferior to him." )
( c_books_train_0095 "The others held back uneasily." )
( c_books_train_0096 "Tabaqui told him that, I know." )
( c_books_train_0097 "Darling who put the handkerchief to Andy's eyes." )
( c_books_train_0098 "Wendy was sure of it." )
( c_books_train_0099 "Shere Andy needed no more trampling." )
( c_books_train_0100 "It wailed through the ship, and died away." )
( c_books_train_0101 "They would have killed him last night, but they needed thee also." )
( c_books_train_0102 "Shere Andy said he would kill would kill!" )
( c_books_train_0103 "He bade me tell you." )
( c_books_train_0104 "He sighs, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0105 "I mustn't tell you anything." )
( c_books_train_0106 "Do you believe? he cried." )
( c_books_train_0107 "Don't get any letters, he said contemptuously." )
( c_books_train_0108 "He heard her savage hiss as the stroke missed." )
( c_books_train_0109 "It need not be said who was the captain." )
( c_books_train_0110 "Waters of the Andy, the Andy-Pack have cast me out." )
( c_books_train_0111 "Nana also troubled him in another way." )
( c_books_train_0112 "Out! snapped Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0113 "He will be frightened. Andy sprang to his feet." )
( c_books_train_0114 "Last time it was because I was a man." )
( c_books_train_0115 "Hook had feared." )
( c_books_train_0116 "That used to be Andy." )
( c_books_train_0117 "There it is, said Andy calmly." )
( c_books_train_0118 "Ai! he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering." )
( c_books_train_0119 "Give him to me." )
( c_books_train_0120 "Besides, Andy was a white seal." )
( c_books_train_0121 "That is only tears such as men use, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0122 "He has driven game for us." )
( c_books_train_0123 "She even tried to make her heart go softly." )
( c_books_train_0124 "In his absence things are usually quiet on the island." )
( c_books_train_0125 "Darling by the fire." )
( c_books_train_0126 "It's disgraceful, he said, blowing out his nostrils." )
( c_books_train_0127 "Would that Andy were here, but we must do what we can." )
( c_books_train_0128 "How wildly we romped! says Andy." )
( c_books_train_0129 "But he never gets there." )
( c_books_train_0130 "What are you to do, Andy? Andy my mother hopes." )
( c_books_train_0131 "Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Andy." )
( c_books_train_0132 "The first to emerge from his tree was Andy." )
( c_books_train_0133 "John let go and met Andy near the bathroom." )
( c_books_train_0134 "Good hunting! cried Andy, sitting up on his haunches." )
( c_books_train_0135 "Come to me, Andy Andy, for there is big game afoot!" )
( c_books_train_0136 "Sneaky tell-tale! Andy called out from somewhere round the corner." )
( c_books_train_0137 "Boy. Andy he had leapt into her arms." )
( c_books_train_0138 "Five. Andy Andy longed to say it." )
( c_books_train_0139 "All things made he Andy the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0140 "Phew! said Andy Andy (he was the eldest of Andy Andy's cubs)." )
( c_books_train_0141 "That opens out on the plain not half a mile from here." )
( c_books_train_0142 "They never go far, he said with a chuckle." )
( c_books_train_0143 "And then one night came the tragedy." )
( c_books_train_0144 "Give me black bones to eat!" )
( c_books_train_0145 "Perhaps it was best not to know." )
( c_books_train_0146 "The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under." )
( c_books_train_0147 "Let us get Andy Andy's skin and go away." )
( c_books_train_0148 "Now you're angry, but never mind, Andy, thy tail hangs down behind!" )
( c_books_train_0149 "I'm going to teach you now." )
( c_books_train_0150 "Turley, and the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0151 "Hook wounded me." )
( c_books_train_0152 "Answer, or I shall teach you again, roared Andy." )
( c_books_train_0153 "The crocodile! he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo'sun." )
( c_books_train_0154 "General Andy of Andy and Andy Andy Andy-tm electronic works .A." )
( c_books_train_0155 "He throw a rope?" )
( c_books_train_0156 "Hah! said Andy with a chuckle, he has friends everywhere, this manling." )
( c_books_train_0157 "Hai, hai, hai!" )
( c_books_train_0158 "Turn and see." )
( c_books_train_0159 "They never do what they set out to do." )
( c_books_train_0160 "Unrip your plan, captain, he cried eagerly." )
( c_books_train_0161 "Little Andy stared again and again." )
( c_books_train_0162 "But they lost their tempers long before they got there." )
( c_books_train_0163 "Then he made it out." )
( c_books_train_0164 "They were the most ordinary questionsWhat was the colour of Andy's eyes?" )
( c_books_train_0165 "Salaam karo, my children." )
( c_books_train_0166 "Then he felt better." )
( c_books_train_0167 "Who are you? Andy Andy, E troop, Andy Andy Andy Andy's horse." )
( c_books_train_0168 "Sing to your fledglings again, Andy, oh lift up your head!" )
( c_books_train_0169 "No, worse than that." )
( c_books_train_0170 "I wish to eat, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0171 "Let them breathe, Andy, he said, holding up his hand." )
( c_books_train_0172 "She was a tidy child." )
( c_books_train_0173 "He knew that you must not hurry Andy." )
( c_books_train_0174 "You were quite glad that the night-lights were on." )
( c_books_train_0175 "We know now that no one had been hit." )
( c_books_train_0176 "Come on, father, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0177 "I would almost rather have no children at all, she said disdainfully." )
( c_books_train_0178 "We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle!" )
( c_books_train_0179 "Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle butcher?" )
( c_books_train_0180 "Again Andy's genius surmounted difficulties." )
( c_books_train_0181 "She had to tell him." )
( c_books_train_0182 "Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side already." )
( c_books_train_0183 "The Andy's EIN or federal tax identification number is -." )
( c_books_train_0184 "What have we to do with this toothless fool?" )
( c_books_train_0185 "I am no wizard, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0186 "And Andy looked at him steadily between the eyes." )
( c_books_train_0187 "It is a sort of very sad seal Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0188 "Now for the first time we hear the voice of Andy." )
( c_books_train_0189 "He stood motionless, one hand to his ear." )
( c_books_train_0190 "Then there was a howl an untigerish howl from Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0191 "(Woe betide thee, Andy!)" )
( c_books_train_0192 "I am weary of this man-wolf folly." )
( c_books_train_0193 "Gut our house." )
( c_books_train_0194 "He would keep no girl in the Andy against her will." )
( c_books_train_0195 "She had to run about after him, though it was rather undignified." )
( c_books_train_0196 "Lie still, little frog." )
( c_books_train_0197 "Tootles, she cried, I appeal to you. Andy it not strange?" )
( c_books_train_0198 "Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all." )
( c_books_train_0199 "Come then, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0200 "But the sea cows did not answer because Andy Andy cannot talk." )
( c_books_train_0201 "And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us." )
( c_books_train_0202 "Meantime, Andy and Andy were furious with rage and grief." )
( c_books_train_0203 "She was only a little girl." )
( c_books_train_0204 "Yes, my little man, Andy anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles." )
( c_books_train_0205 "Hide me! he cried hoarsely." )
( c_books_train_0206 "And we have killed her, Andy said hoarsely." )
( c_books_train_0207 "Blackbeard Andy. Andy was naturally impressed." )
( c_books_train_0208 "By the Andy that bought me I made a promise a little promise." )
( c_books_train_0209 "Oh, hear the call! Andy hunting all Andy keep the Andy Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0210 "Toward the sunset, I believe, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0211 "He was quite a practical boy." )
( c_books_train_0212 "Else why should he go hunting these wild devils?" )
( c_books_train_0213 "See! Andy held up the fire-pot." )
( c_books_train_0214 "This shall end when one is dead; (At thy pleasure, Andy.)" )
( c_books_train_0215 "It was securely fastened." )
( c_books_train_0216 "Sea Andy must be wiser than I thought." )
( c_books_train_0217 "Mother! Andy's Andy, she said." )
( c_books_train_0218 "Fancy Andy snapping!" )
( c_books_train_0219 "You'll be beaten for this in the morning." )
( c_books_train_0220 "The Andy Andy had led them for a year now." )
( c_books_train_0221 "He was seeking bigger game." )
( c_books_train_0222 "There is no harm in a man's cub." )
( c_books_train_0223 "It must be sewn on, she said, just a little patronisingly." )
( c_books_train_0224 "I also have made a little promise." )
( c_books_train_0225 "The hooded Andy has missed!" )
( c_books_train_0226 "I am ashamed to meet all these people." )
( c_books_train_0227 "You remember about her pet wolf." )
( c_books_train_0228 "Then I refuse, he cried, banging the barrel in front of Andy." )
( c_books_train_0229 "Heavy is the hide of Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0230 "This shows how real the island was." )
( c_books_train_0231 "Now, don't be angry after you've been afraid." )
( c_books_train_0232 "I myself will teach him. Andy need yet another, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0233 "That will at least save the Andy three lives." )
( c_books_train_0234 "Roses, cried Andy sternly." )
( c_books_train_0235 "Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches." )
( c_books_train_0236 "Tell me his nest and his name." )
( c_books_train_0237 "Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head." )
( c_books_train_0238 "Who has delivered us, who?" )
( c_books_train_0239 "I did it!" )
( c_books_train_0240 "They throw stones and talk child's talk." )
( c_books_train_0241 "He is Andy, my son, Andy, said Andy Andy, scowling." )
( c_books_train_0242 "All the cobras are dead." )
( c_books_train_0243 "In truth, I have lived too long." )
( c_books_train_0244 "I take my life from thee tonight." )
( c_books_train_0245 "Next year he did not come for her." )
( c_books_train_0246 "I shall wait here till he comes." )
( c_books_train_0247 "I might have known that thou wouldst not forget me." )
( c_books_train_0248 "For a time he was afraid of being dropped." )
( c_books_train_0249 "The boy broke it with a stone! shrieked Andy's wife." )
( c_books_train_0250 "What is there to be afraid of? said the priest." )
( c_books_train_0251 "Ah, old lady, said Andy, hanging up his gun." )
( c_books_train_0252 "See paragraph .E below." )
( c_books_train_0253 "Perhaps there was some excuse for him." )
( c_books_train_0254 "Matkah knew better than to answer back." )
( c_books_train_0255 "The Andy Andy? said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0256 "Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward." )
( c_books_train_0257 "John, Andy, Andy would cry, wake up!" )
( c_books_train_0258 "What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock?" )
( c_books_train_0259 "All things made he Andy the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0260 "Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives Andy and I. Andy matter." )
( c_books_train_0261 "The door opened and a lady came out." )
( c_books_train_0262 "How large are their eyes!" )
( c_books_train_0263 "We all say so, and so it must be true, they shouted." )
( c_books_train_0264 "Evil that plagued us is slain, Andy in the garden lies dead." )
( c_books_train_0265 "ho! said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0266 "Can't you hear, Andy-tikki? Andy-tikki listened." )
( c_books_train_0267 "And again and again he darted in and pricked." )
( c_books_train_0268 "It was her silence they had heard." )
( c_books_train_0269 "For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence." )
( c_books_train_0270 "We must sing his death song." )
( c_books_train_0271 "In the meantime Andy." )
( c_books_train_0272 "He has no right, whispered Andy." )
( c_books_train_0273 "Little one, what is thy name? said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0274 "Ochen scoochnie! (I'm lonesome, very lonesome!) said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0275 "All he said was: Andy well, O Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0276 "They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains." )
( c_books_train_0277 "Thou art the master, said Andy in an undertone." )
( c_books_train_0278 "He knows more than we, said Andy, trembling." )
( c_books_train_0279 "Till the sides are higher than Andy Andy can jump, shouted Andy." )
( c_books_train_0280 "I am old, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0281 "Let us do what Andy wishes! cried the simple boys." )
( c_books_train_0282 "This tie, it will not tie. Andy became dangerously sarcastic." )
( c_books_train_0283 "Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce." )
( c_books_train_0284 "Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Andy, go!" )
( c_books_train_0285 "The difficulty is which one to choose." )
( c_books_train_0286 "Remember that it grows in little pots." )
( c_books_train_0287 "I will go as fast as I can, he said anxiously." )
( c_books_train_0288 "Perhaps he is ill, Andy said." )
( c_books_train_0289 "We could lie doubled up, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0290 "See, O Andy, they never thank their teacher." )
( c_books_train_0291 "My hook thinks you did, said Andy, crossing to him." )
( c_books_train_0292 "But news is always good." )
( c_books_train_0293 "These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids." )
( c_books_train_0294 "Now will you tell? said Andy, all out of breath." )
( c_books_train_0295 "COME AWAY, COME AWAY!" )
( c_books_train_0296 "Hullo, Andy, cried the wondering boys." )
( c_books_train_0297 "He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself." )
( c_books_train_0298 "We are wonderful." )
( c_books_train_0299 "They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence." )
( c_books_train_0300 "He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth." )
( c_books_train_0301 "Yes. Andy Andy smiled again." )
( c_books_train_0302 "Which of these adventures shall we choose?" )
( c_books_train_0303 "Great Andy, he said at last in a husky whisper." )
( c_books_train_0304 "Nagaina is dead!" )
( c_books_train_0305 "It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom." )
( c_books_train_0306 "I I may have cried out in the battle, Andy answered." )
( c_books_train_0307 "Darling began playing again." )
( c_books_train_0308 "The stories they told, before it was time for Andy's good-night story!" )
( c_books_train_0309 "Thou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf." )
( c_books_train_0310 "Darling now, recalling it." )
( c_books_train_0311 "What is this folly? said Andy angrily." )
( c_books_train_0312 "He hasn't even begun to drink his milk, Andy interposed." )
( c_books_train_0313 "Then Andy tried slow and distinct." )
( c_books_train_0314 "And Andy Andy had been spoken to by Andy Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0315 "Which will win?" )
( c_books_train_0316 "No. Andy's awfully puzzling, said Andy, who knew the story by heart." )
( c_books_train_0317 "Art thou not afraid? Andy." )
( c_books_train_0318 "They must be swimming back or flying, the boys concluded." )
( c_books_train_0319 "To find your mother, she coaxed." )
( c_books_train_0320 "What is it? he said." )
( c_books_train_0321 "He shall become a great tracker." )
( c_books_train_0322 "But not one dared to face the door." )
( c_books_train_0323 "And it was so in all the other islands that he visited." )
( c_books_train_0324 "Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully." )
( c_books_train_0325 "She was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_." )
( c_books_train_0326 "How do you know where to go to? he panted." )
( c_books_train_0327 "Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine, he cried." )
( c_books_train_0328 "A hundred will do." )
( c_books_train_0329 "He gave Andy one of their combs." )
( c_books_train_0330 "Instant obedience was the only safe thing." )
( c_books_train_0331 "At present she was full of jealousy of Andy." )
( c_books_train_0332 "At the gates in the twilight he would kill Andy, the Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0333 "Five drops of this he now added to Andy's cup." )
( c_books_train_0334 "Not three figures, four!" )
( c_books_train_0335 "Things! he said." )
( c_books_train_0336 "Free Andy, he cried, does Andy Andy lead the Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0337 "Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out." )
( c_books_train_0338 "There was no way of knowing, save by going down." )
( c_books_train_0339 "Bad form, he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile." )
( c_books_train_0340 "Many elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before." )
( c_books_train_0341 "Not round my neck!" )
( c_books_train_0342 "Mark my trail! Andy shouted." )
( c_books_train_0343 "He saved our lives and Andy's life, she said to her husband." )
( c_books_train_0344 "Men will not make thee forget? said Andy Andy anxiously." )
( c_books_train_0345 "They are trying to join again. Andy slipped on to Andy's back." )
( c_books_train_0346 "Of course Andy was the first to get his word in." )
( c_books_train_0347 "Now really and truly it was finished." )
( c_books_train_0348 "You see you can't fly, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0349 "Valiant Andy-tikki is dead!" )
( c_books_train_0350 "Why can't you be sensible and settle your places quietly?" )
( c_books_train_0351 "What does Andy Andy need? Andy quarry." )
( c_books_train_0352 "Tink said that the shadow was in the big box." )
( c_books_train_0353 "Ye will not kill him, because that is not my will." )
( c_books_train_0354 "You may be sure Andy." )
( c_books_train_0355 "What is the use of that? thought Andy-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0356 "Such a little thing for Andy. and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0357 "Arre! said two or three women together." )
( c_books_train_0358 "Where am I? she said." )
( c_books_train_0359 "That night Andy danced the Andy-dance with the yearling seals." )
( c_books_train_0360 "It is Andy's ghost!" )
( c_books_train_0361 "I shall be sick, you know, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0362 "He could do very well without one." )
( c_books_train_0363 "The fool! said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0364 "If she had known she would not have snapped." )
( c_books_train_0365 "But Andy hesitated." )
( c_books_train_0366 "All thanks for this good meal, he said, licking his lips." )
( c_books_train_0367 "And we are your children, cried the twins." )
( c_books_train_0368 "None of them knew." )
( c_books_train_0369 "Let the jungle listen to the things I have done." )
( c_books_train_0370 "Three, he said." )
( c_books_train_0371 "He will die in the winter rains." )
( c_books_train_0372 "He is smaller than a picket-pin." )
( c_books_train_0373 "I can suppose only that, like Andy." )
( c_books_train_0374 "Darling was placid." )
( c_books_train_0375 "What is it? he cried again." )
( c_books_train_0376 "Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air." )
( c_books_train_0377 "He took Andy. Andy's kiss with him." )
( c_books_train_0378 "That's the way I always do. I say!" )
( c_books_train_0379 "They play all day." )
( c_books_train_0380 "But be wise." )
( c_books_train_0381 "Hook itched to do it, but it seemed too brutal." )
( c_books_train_0382 "Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too." )
( c_books_train_0383 "Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet." )
( c_books_train_0384 "But Andy stood aloof." )
( c_books_train_0385 "As for their dancing, I have seen the place where Andy-bap!" )
( c_books_train_0386 "It's Andy over again, but ten times better, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0387 "Who are you, stranger?" )
( c_books_train_0388 "Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep." )
( c_books_train_0389 "A man's cub went this way, said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0390 "But for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber." )
( c_books_train_0391 "What's a mother? asked the ignorant Andy." )
( c_books_train_0392 "They shall carry thee far through the jungle, manling." )
( c_books_train_0393 "In a horrid silence Andy." )
( c_books_train_0394 "He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard." )
( c_books_train_0395 "For a moment after Andy. and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0396 "It pleased him to see Andy and Andy Andy look uncomfortable." )
( c_books_train_0397 "Pirates! he cried." )
( c_books_train_0398 "And his nose was all sore." )
( c_books_train_0399 "What was it?" )
( c_books_train_0400 "What what will happen? said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0401 "He was frightfully happy." )
( c_books_train_0402 "The order came sharp and incisive." )
( c_books_train_0403 "You are too late, he cried proudly, I have shot the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0404 "What nonsense you talk, precious." )
( c_books_train_0405 "By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense." )
( c_books_train_0406 "He steals the young monkeys in the night." )
( c_books_train_0407 "For Andy? Andy said, aghast." )
( c_books_train_0408 "Now, where does he lie up?" )
( c_books_train_0409 "Mother! Andy cried." )
( c_books_train_0410 "Didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly? Andy called." )
( c_books_train_0411 "They had no thought of fighting it." )
( c_books_train_0412 "The cup was poisoned." )
( c_books_train_0413 "Put dead bats on my head!" )
( c_books_train_0414 "Better do what the captain orders, said Andy nervously." )
( c_books_train_0415 "Is that all? said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0416 "Funny! said Andy gravely." )
( c_books_train_0417 "Hook saw it, and it did Andy a bad service." )
( c_books_train_0418 "He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones." )
( c_books_train_0419 "Nagaina gathered herself together and flung out at him." )
( c_books_train_0420 "So this is the manling, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0421 "She had not long to wait." )
( c_books_train_0422 "It was a serious matter for him." )
( c_books_train_0423 "Years rolled on again, and Andy had a daughter." )
( c_books_train_0424 "Hullo, he said, there's a man inside it. Andy's father! exclaimed Andy." )
( c_books_train_0425 "Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture." )
( c_books_train_0426 "He is a handsome boy." )
( c_books_train_0427 "John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Andy." )
( c_books_train_0428 "He thought them very over-rated persons." )
( c_books_train_0429 "For that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity." )
( c_books_train_0430 "She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy." )
( c_books_train_0431 "Wait a little." )
( c_books_train_0432 "Now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins." )
( c_books_train_0433 "Save me, save me! cried Andy, falling on the ground." )
( c_books_train_0434 "Mr. and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0435 "I thought all the fairies were dead, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0436 "Darling said at once that she would have them; but Andy." )
( c_books_train_0437 "John, he said, shuddering, it's most beastly stuff." )
( c_books_train_0438 "For them the happy hunting-grounds was now." )
( c_books_train_0439 "The first twin came to Andy." )
( c_books_train_0440 "Here is another ford, and we must swim the calves." )
( c_books_train_0441 "Are you shot? Andy whispered tremulously." )
( c_books_train_0442 "Stand over a little, there. Andy, beg your pardon, said the mule." )
( c_books_train_0443 "Waters of the Andy, whither went Andy Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0444 "Peter flung out his arms." )
( c_books_train_0445 "I can't help you, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0446 "To Andy the loneliness was dreadful." )
( c_books_train_0447 "Bagheera followed in case of accidents." )
( c_books_train_0448 "Keep thy hand on my shoulder, Andy whispered." )
( c_books_train_0449 "They stood in a row in front of Andy." )
( c_books_train_0450 "So it is! said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0451 "Tie her up! he shouted." )
( c_books_train_0452 "Thus perished many of the flower of the Andy tribe." )
( c_books_train_0453 "Do they never go to sleep?" )
( c_books_train_0454 "Akela has missed, said the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0455 "He shall become greater than I, even I, Andy Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0456 "I am alone on the grazing-grounds." )
( c_books_train_0457 "To tell poor Andy that they thought him lovable!" )
( c_books_train_0458 "The monkeys leaped higher up the walls." )
( c_books_train_0459 "Starkey's ringleader! Andy, mercy! Andy whimpered, all of a tremble now." )
( c_books_train_0460 "Make a plan." )
( c_books_train_0461 "Why not both take it at the same time? Andy, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0462 "Never was luck on a pirate ship wi' a woman on board." )
( c_books_train_0463 "Stop that row, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0464 "The boat drew nearer." )
( c_books_train_0465 "He looked up into Andy Andy's face, and laughed." )
( c_books_train_0466 "Go away, she cried." )
( c_books_train_0467 "Now we are talking just like men!" )
( c_books_train_0468 "Of course it is Andy night, Andy, Andy said, relenting." )
( c_books_train_0469 "No, it isn't, he said." )
( c_books_train_0470 "Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0471 "Having done these things, he went on again." )
( c_books_train_0472 "A doe now, or even a young buck?" )
( c_books_train_0473 "It may have been Andy, but it was magnificent." )
( c_books_train_0474 "Let them breathe." )
( c_books_train_0475 "But, on the other hand, there were the leaves." )
( c_books_train_0476 "I wish he had been a white rat, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0477 "Everything was wrong." )
( c_books_train_0478 "The valiant Andy-tikki caught him by the head and held fast." )
( c_books_train_0479 "Sleepest thou still, Andy Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0480 "Where all this time was Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0481 "You see, I don't know any stories." )
( c_books_train_0482 "Its parents have run off." )
( c_books_train_0483 "They are still and white." )
( c_books_train_0484 "He is the worst of them all." )
( c_books_train_0485 "He has troubled the jungle for ten seasons." )
( c_books_train_0486 "It was not such a night as he would have chosen." )
( c_books_train_0487 "He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it." )
( c_books_train_0488 "Have you not seen her? asked Andy, becoming troubled." )
( c_books_train_0489 "This is the way of the Andy-kind." )
( c_books_train_0490 "There is a great assembly in his honor." )
( c_books_train_0491 "Let us take the man-cub and go." )
( c_books_train_0492 "We are beginning to know Andy." )
( c_books_train_0493 "What was the colour of Andy's eyes, and so on." )
( c_books_train_0494 "And it is I, Andy [The Andy], who answers." )
( c_books_train_0495 "They knew it; but as their father's sons they acquitted themselves." )
( c_books_train_0496 "Go and ask Andy Andy, said Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0497 "(Hit him, hit him!)" )
( c_books_train_0498 "What harm can a naked frog do us?" )
( c_books_train_0499 "Great is Andy-tikki with the white teeth. Andy my white teeth!" )
( c_books_train_0500 "There should have been a fourth night-light." )
( c_books_train_0501 "Stop shaking, youngster." )
( c_books_train_0502 "Yes, he is rather cocky, Andy admitted with regret." )
( c_books_train_0503 "Darling also, but they forgot about him." )
( c_books_train_0504 "Lads, he cried to his crew, now here's a notion." )
( c_books_train_0505 "Michael is an engine-driver." )
( c_books_train_0506 "What dost thou know of softness, old Andy-feet? Andy grunted." )
( c_books_train_0507 "Into the water, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0508 "But remember, Andy, he is very little. I will remember." )
( c_books_train_0509 "Hide her, they whispered, and gathered hastily around Andy." )
( c_books_train_0510 "Perhaps Andy is inside it, Andy said." )
( c_books_train_0511 "His hide will look well on the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0512 "Something! echoed Andy." )
( c_books_train_0513 "It is the kiss I gave her." )
( c_books_train_0514 "; and he was struck by Andy's picking him out." )
( c_books_train_0515 "Oho, Andy, what dost thou do here?" )
( c_books_train_0516 "Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table." )
( c_books_train_0517 "Swiftly turn them!" )
( c_books_train_0518 "Nibs and Andy were first and second mate." )
( c_books_train_0519 "The children gazed at each other." )
( c_books_train_0520 "They have no law." )
( c_books_train_0521 "The real Andy was also in the water." )
( c_books_train_0522 "He had his first laugh still." )
( c_books_train_0523 "That is why there are night-lights." )
( c_books_train_0524 "The Andy-People are forbidden, said Andy, forbidden to the Andy-People." )
( c_books_train_0525 "These are my last words, dear boys, she said firmly." )
( c_books_train_0526 "Can't guess, can't guess! crowed Andy." )
( c_books_train_0527 "She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother." )
( c_books_train_0528 "Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much." )
( c_books_train_0529 "Rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself." )
( c_books_train_0530 "Darling does not blame us." )
( c_books_train_0531 "I'll rescue her! he cried, leaping at his weapons." )
( c_books_train_0532 "Akela said nothing." )
( c_books_train_0533 "He will scorch in the sun." )
( c_books_train_0534 "I wish I could show you our business." )
( c_books_train_0535 "But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon." )
( c_books_train_0536 "Then follow the leader, he cried gaily." )
( c_books_train_0537 "Bagheera has noticed us." )
( c_books_train_0538 "Darling always said, I am responsible for it all." )
( c_books_train_0539 "He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit." )
( c_books_train_0540 "They do not hit me with their hard paws." )
( c_books_train_0541 "Very good, he said." )
( c_books_train_0542 "But now go hence quickly with thy friends." )
( c_books_train_0543 "That means there's a gale behind me." )
( c_books_train_0544 "Mine, Andy, said Andy on his knees." )
( c_books_train_0545 "Very soft is his skin, and he is not unlike the Andy-log." )
( c_books_train_0546 "Should we take the brush with the redskins at Andy Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0547 "Art thou there?" )
( c_books_train_0548 "Chairs and a fender first, Andy ordered." )
( c_books_train_0549 "The clearing, as he remembered it, had grown in the night." )
( c_books_train_0550 "I suppose it comes to the same thing." )
( c_books_train_0551 "Don't you wish you had extra hands?" )
( c_books_train_0552 "Then everybody in the jungle suffers." )
( c_books_train_0553 "To be bitten by wolves, poor child!" )
( c_books_train_0554 "Peter struck true and deep." )
( c_books_train_0555 "Fetch the cat, Andy, said Andy; it's in the cabin. Andy cabin!" )
( c_books_train_0556 "On the bed lay Andy fast asleep." )
( c_books_train_0557 "He had a sudden idea." )
( c_books_train_0558 "He has slept with us." )
( c_books_train_0559 "And yet a third time he sighs, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0560 "Unless you have removed all references to Andy Andy: .E.." )
( c_books_train_0561 "Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs." )
( c_books_train_0562 "I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee." )
( c_books_train_0563 "She had said it so often that Andy needed no translation." )
( c_books_train_0564 "If we went there they would say we were afraid." )
( c_books_train_0565 "I have told the bats to watch through the dark time." )
( c_books_train_0566 "Scatter them, or they will be fighting one another." )
( c_books_train_0567 "Now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon." )
( c_books_train_0568 "It would not have been fighting fair." )
( c_books_train_0569 "I don't want to be a man." )
( c_books_train_0570 "Shall we swim or fly, Andy? Andy had to tell her." )
( c_books_train_0571 "The Andy bird became irritated; they have very short tempers." )
( c_books_train_0572 "Then at last he spoke passionately." )
( c_books_train_0573 "I've waited long to shake his hand with this." )
( c_books_train_0574 "Roll to the water tanks." )
( c_books_train_0575 "My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand." )
( c_books_train_0576 "All things made he Andy the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0577 "Think of mummy!" )
( c_books_train_0578 "He is there." )
( c_books_train_0579 "No, give him to me." )
( c_books_train_0580 "He had forgotten the egg." )
( c_books_train_0581 "I cannot climb out, cried Andy." )
( c_books_train_0582 "Go! Andy Andy looked on amazed." )
( c_books_train_0583 "Boat ahoy! again came the voice." )
( c_books_train_0584 "The others drew back and formed a ring around them." )
( c_books_train_0585 "Very touching was his deference to Andy." )
( c_books_train_0586 "But he was far too proud for that." )
( c_books_train_0587 "The Andy dropped his head lightly for a minute on Andy's shoulder." )
( c_books_train_0588 "Then I shall get up, he said." )
( c_books_train_0589 "They made more room with their feet." )
( c_books_train_0590 "I am a village herd for a while." )
( c_books_train_0591 "Well! said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0592 "Peter Andy save me, me his velly nice friend." )
( c_books_train_0593 "I once thought of calling myself Andy-handed Andy, he said diffidently." )
( c_books_train_0594 "Aha, they will die. Andy had listened with growing admiration." )
( c_books_train_0595 "What's sewn? he asked." )
( c_books_train_0596 "When thou hast seen the elephants dance." )
( c_books_train_0597 "No six men could have divided the herd so neatly." )
( c_books_train_0598 "I'm Andy, she said agitatedly." )
( c_books_train_0599 "At last Andy had got the boon for which he craved." )
( c_books_train_0600 "But I will be more merciful than ye are." )
( c_books_train_0601 "We are very miserable, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0602 "To begin a night's work with that noise!" )
( c_books_train_0603 "The Andy Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0604 "Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Andy." )
( c_books_train_0605 "Men and their cubs are very wise." )
( c_books_train_0606 "His face is all bruised today by thy softness." )
( c_books_train_0607 "The pity of the Andy Andy! Andy snorted." )
( c_books_train_0608 "Who said I wasn't getting up? she cried." )
( c_books_train_0609 "Aren't these camels too sickening for anything?" )
( c_books_train_0610 "They sang and danced in their night-gowns." )
( c_books_train_0611 "We are putting the redskin on the rock, Andy called out." )
( c_books_train_0612 "His eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink." )
( c_books_train_0613 "He bared his breast." )
( c_books_train_0614 "Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed." )
( c_books_train_0615 "Keep count, for I will do your herding no more." )
( c_books_train_0616 "And then he called aloud: Andy the tank, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0617 "He is doomed to die!" )
( c_books_train_0618 "THE SHADOW Andy." )
( c_books_train_0619 "I always cut their hair myself, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0620 "Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it." )
( c_books_train_0621 "Perhaps it is old Andy's ghost." )
( c_books_train_0622 "By the Andy Andy of Andy! he said, beneath his mustache." )
( c_books_train_0623 "He signed to her to listen." )
( c_books_train_0624 "Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?" )
( c_books_train_0625 "Farewell! Andy, once more, Andy, he cried." )
( c_books_train_0626 "Are you sure, Andy? Andy, yes. Andy." )
( c_books_train_0627 "Whose arrow? he demanded sternly." )
( c_books_train_0628 "Let us build a little house round her. Andy were all delighted." )
( c_books_train_0629 "No, no! they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled." )
( c_books_train_0630 "Uglier, and with worse manners!" )
( c_books_train_0631 "Hook was profoundly dejected." )
( c_books_train_0632 "There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution." )
( c_books_train_0633 "He's tickling under my chin, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0634 "Rikk-tck-tck! chuckled Andy-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0635 "Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast?" )
( c_books_train_0636 "Up and down they went, and round and round." )
( c_books_train_0637 "They have no remembrance." )
( c_books_train_0638 "Well, then, he cried, I am Andy Andy. Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0639 "I think I knew them, said Andy rather doubtfully." )
( c_books_train_0640 "How long has it taken?" )
( c_books_train_0641 "How topping! said Andy and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0642 "The Andy-People, watching in the trees, considered his play most wonderful." )
( c_books_train_0643 "He is too big." )
( c_books_train_0644 "We must block that end." )
( c_books_train_0645 "Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh." )
( c_books_train_0646 "I am a very poor man, he sobbed." )
( c_books_train_0647 "Good! said the young wolves, who are always hungry." )
( c_books_train_0648 "A hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur." )
( c_books_train_0649 "Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast a cool head." )
( c_books_train_0650 "Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward." )
( c_books_train_0651 "Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night." )
( c_books_train_0652 "He could take his medicine." )
( c_books_train_0653 ""Project Andy" is a registered trademark." )
( c_books_train_0654 "Speak! Andy demanded." )
( c_books_train_0655 "Once, twice and again!" )
( c_books_train_0656 "He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled." )
( c_books_train_0657 "Michael first, he said doggedly." )
( c_books_train_0658 "They may drop him if we follow too close. Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0659 "Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back." )
( c_books_train_0660 "I am ready." )
( c_books_train_0661 "Peter, you just spoil them, you know, Andy simpered." )
( c_books_train_0662 "'Twas he cut off my arm. Andy brandished the hook threateningly." )
( c_books_train_0663 "The captain! said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise." )
( c_books_train_0664 "It's worth trying, they said doubtfully." )
( c_books_train_0665 "Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising." )
( c_books_train_0666 "The Andy-log have shifted their grounds, he said quietly." )
( c_books_train_0667 "Let them fall, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0668 "He fell forward." )
( c_books_train_0669 "Shere Andy dare not kill thee in the jungle." )
( c_books_train_0670 "Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it." )
( c_books_train_0671 "This is no bird, he said in a scared voice." )
( c_books_train_0672 "Out with the light!" )
( c_books_train_0673 "Darling do not go out for the evening." )
( c_books_train_0674 "They are the bites of wolves." )
( c_books_train_0675 "Kotick followed, panting and wondering." )
( c_books_train_0676 "It was one of those boys you hate." )
( c_books_train_0677 "There's one, replied the figure." )
( c_books_train_0678 "Ts! said Andy, weaving his head to and fro." )
( c_books_train_0679 "That is about the only thing fairies can't do." )
( c_books_train_0680 "He killed at dawn, a pig, and he has drunk too." )
( c_books_train_0681 "I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants." )
( c_books_train_0682 "He was dead, and the kites were coming for him already." )
( c_books_train_0683 "But how long ago?" )
( c_books_train_0684 "And so this is a man's cub." )
( c_books_train_0685 "Have I kept my word? said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0686 "No one spoke except Andy." )
( c_books_train_0687 "Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her." )
( c_books_train_0688 "I haven't tried yet, Andy whispered back." )
( c_books_train_0689 "Of course Andy." )
( c_books_train_0690 "Of course Andy." )
( c_books_train_0691 "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi Andy the hole where he went in Andy-Eye called to Andy-Skin." )
( c_books_train_0692 "Tick tick tick tick!" )
( c_books_train_0693 "The pirates had fired Andy Andy at them." )
( c_books_train_0694 "She was asleep." )
( c_books_train_0695 "It was indeed the crocodile." )
( c_books_train_0696 "Why should I fear?" )
( c_books_train_0697 "Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister." )
( c_books_train_0698 "Something blew out the light, he said a little unsteadily." )
( c_books_train_0699 "To think that thou canst skin a tiger!" )
( c_books_train_0700 "Darling loved to have everything just so, and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0701 "Two, said Andy solemnly." )
( c_books_train_0702 "Mother, don't pamper him, he called after her." )
( c_books_train_0703 "She was always so particular about their flannels." )
( c_books_train_0704 "We now return to the nursery." )
( c_books_train_0705 "What am I to do? said Andy-tikki-tavi." )
( c_books_train_0706 "None of us has any pockets. Andy could she resist." )
( c_books_train_0707 "); Andy came and went in legions that darkened all the shore." )
( c_books_train_0708 "Come and fight with me." )
( c_books_train_0709 "There has never been a white seal since since I was born." )
( c_books_train_0710 "Mowgli, the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0711 "It was because he was so terribly alone." )
( c_books_train_0712 "Akela! said Andy, clapping his hands." )
( c_books_train_0713 "Oh dear no!" )
( c_books_train_0714 "Hullo, he said." )
( c_books_train_0715 "They came into our lines while we were asleep." )
( c_books_train_0716 "One of us at least needs food." )
( c_books_train_0717 "Twice Andy beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully." )
( c_books_train_0718 "They have promised me this." )
( c_books_train_0719 "'Twas your own orders, the bo'sun faltered." )
( c_books_train_0720 "Was his enemy to escape him after all?" )
( c_books_train_0721 "Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry." )
( c_books_train_0722 "Now we have him, Andy shouted." )
( c_books_train_0723 "Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk? said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0724 "Roll and plunge!" )
( c_books_train_0725 "Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Andy; but Andy." )
( c_books_train_0726 "She can't sleep except when she's sleepy." )
( c_books_train_0727 "Some king had built it long ago on a little hill." )
( c_books_train_0728 "He was a little boy, and she was grown up." )
( c_books_train_0729 "That is the Andy of the Andy. Andy obeyed faithfully." )
( c_books_train_0730 "O evil day! cried Andy." )
( c_books_train_0731 "Then he began to mutter a prayer." )
( c_books_train_0732 "He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name." )
( c_books_train_0733 "The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing." )
( c_books_train_0734 "Darling was now dead and forgotten." )
( c_books_train_0735 "The others did not hear her." )
( c_books_train_0736 "What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?" )
( c_books_train_0737 "Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched." )
( c_books_train_0738 "Where are you going? she cried with misgiving." )
( c_books_train_0739 "What is that?" )
( c_books_train_0740 "I did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy." )
( c_books_train_0741 "Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed." )
( c_books_train_0742 "How to convey them?" )
( c_books_train_0743 "Darling thought this showed want of firmness." )
( c_books_train_0744 "We complain of Andy, cried the twins." )
( c_books_train_0745 "Ahoy there, you lubbers! he called." )
( c_books_train_0746 "begs to be excused! Andy thought Andy." )
( c_books_train_0747 "It may be that I have stolen one of them." )
( c_books_train_0748 "They are without leaders." )
( c_books_train_0749 "He is a dog's son." )
( c_books_train_0750 "Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother." )
( c_books_train_0751 "Mermaids! said Andy again." )
( c_books_train_0752 "Now for the Andy-People, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0753 "He's calling for me." )
( c_books_train_0754 "Don't be frightened, Andy, said his father." )
( c_books_train_0755 "Let me get up!" )
( c_books_train_0756 "That shows they have no mother." )
( c_books_train_0757 "They grow tired of the nuts they pick, and throw them down." )
( c_books_train_0758 "A man's cub." )
( c_books_train_0759 "He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it." )
( c_books_train_0760 "Teddy shouted to the house: Andy, look here!" )
( c_books_train_0761 "He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was." )
( c_books_train_0762 "To Andy of the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0763 "Shall I turn them into the jungle? Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0764 "It oozed on after Andy." )
( c_books_train_0765 "We'll fit in, sir, they assured him." )
( c_books_train_0766 "Darling must have done." )
( c_books_train_0767 "_Mea culpa, mea culpa_. Andy had had a classical education." )
( c_books_train_0768 "Then again he frowned." )
( c_books_train_0769 "That is why, he said, shifting his paw on the leaves." )
( c_books_train_0770 "I see that ye are dogs." )
( c_books_train_0771 "Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first." )
( c_books_train_0772 "Wake up! barked Andy, for the gulls were making a great noise." )
( c_books_train_0773 "Quick, Andy, quick, she screamed." )
( c_books_train_0774 "I flewed! he screamed while still in mid-air." )
( c_books_train_0775 "It was Andy." )
( c_books_train_0776 "He had a happy idea." )
( c_books_train_0777 "Now we must go back to the first tale." )
( c_books_train_0778 "My tail tingles, youngster, he said." )
( c_books_train_0779 "She looked round and cooed: Andy thoughtful of you." )
( c_books_train_0780 "Smee had been waiting for it." )
( c_books_train_0781 "This I, scouting alone, beheld, Andy, twice and again!" )
( c_books_train_0782 "Can they be Andy and Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0783 "That thou shouldst never be one of these hill buffaloes of trackers." )
( c_books_train_0784 "But what was that?" )
( c_books_train_0785 "For a young cobra?" )
( c_books_train_0786 "The cool of the summer sun!" )
( c_books_train_0787 "U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff." )
( c_books_train_0788 "It was Andy, the Andy, and his wife." )
( c_books_train_0789 "Give me the egg, Andy-tikki." )
( c_books_train_0790 "Mr. and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0791 "That tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows." )
( c_books_train_0792 "He tottered out, haggard." )
( c_books_train_0793 "This trick had been in his head all the time." )
( c_books_train_0794 "Oh, it's you, said he." )
( c_books_train_0795 " all this time; and yet we may be sure that Andy." )
( c_books_train_0796 "I'm so sorry, said Andy Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0797 "Down hurry them down, Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0798 "Darling and Andy rushed into the nursery too late." )
( c_books_train_0799 "At last he cried, Andy him to the brisket! but without conviction." )
( c_books_train_0800 "He shall not be killed." )
( c_books_train_0801 "The stones slip under my feet!" )
( c_books_train_0802 "The Andy of Andy the home where we were born!" )
( c_books_train_0803 "Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect." )
( c_books_train_0804 "Anon he caught the word Andy." )
( c_books_train_0805 "Strangely, it was not in the water that they met." )
( c_books_train_0806 "He dances like Andy the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0807 "I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band." )
( c_books_train_0808 "Singed jungle cat go now!" )
( c_books_train_0809 "That's what some of our horses do, and I don't blame them." )
( c_books_train_0810 "We are no more than servants." )
( c_books_train_0811 "Darzee stopped with a little shout." )
( c_books_train_0812 "Wendy's servants! Andy, said Andy, and you also." )
( c_books_train_0813 "Stay you sssso! Andy hissed, and the city was silent once more." )
( c_books_train_0814 "He did not know his own strength in the least." )
( c_books_train_0815 "The big panther turned his head away in half a minute." )
( c_books_train_0816 "I also have known what love is." )
( c_books_train_0817 "Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown." )
( c_books_train_0818 "It was as if he had been clipped at every joint." )
( c_books_train_0819 "You eat eggs." )
( c_books_train_0820 "Drive them to and fro as I order." )
( c_books_train_0821 "Did you say you would go, Andy? he said musingly." )
( c_books_train_0822 "Set her free, came the astonishing answer." )
( c_books_train_0823 "He was Andy's bo'sun, Andy whispered huskily." )
( c_books_train_0824 "Good hunting for us all, he answered." )
( c_books_train_0825 "Then she gave Andy." )
( c_books_train_0826 "Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance." )
( c_books_train_0827 "Do you think he is a cypher, Andy? Andy, I don't." )
( c_books_train_0828 "He wriggled overboard and Andy leapt after him." )
( c_books_train_0829 "Certainly not. Andy is not really our father, Andy answered." )
( c_books_train_0830 "Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives." )
( c_books_train_0831 "Shall we still be respectful subjects of the Andy? Andy inquired." )
( c_books_train_0832 "Don't look behind you, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0833 "Save Andy from the death." )
( c_books_train_0834 "Slightly is the most conceited of the boys." )
( c_books_train_0835 "It is nothing." )
( c_books_train_0836 "Below, there was dead silence." )
( c_books_train_0837 "This is wilder work than driving black-buck." )
( c_books_train_0838 "But he means to kill thee. Andy good, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0839 "In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke." )
( c_books_train_0840 "Ahem! said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0841 "Hold your tongue, Andy, his father rapped out." )
( c_books_train_0842 "Will they reach the nursery in time?" )
( c_books_train_0843 "Quiet, their mother admonished them." )
( c_books_train_0844 "I know she admires you tremendously, Andy, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0845 "Big Andy heard him and grunted." )
( c_books_train_0846 "Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend." )
( c_books_train_0847 "Shake hands, Andy, said Andy, proffering his claw." )
( c_books_train_0848 "Then he spoke." )
( c_books_train_0849 "Not only smoke came out of it." )
( c_books_train_0850 "Is Andy asleep? they asked." )
( c_books_train_0851 "I will tell you where they are." )
( c_books_train_0852 "Art thou hurt? said Andy, hugging him softly." )
( c_books_train_0853 "This gave Andy an idea." )
( c_books_train_0854 "Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast." )
( c_books_train_0855 "O Andy, Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0856 "There shall be no war between any of us in the Andy." )
( c_books_train_0857 "Baloo and thou are wounded." )
( c_books_train_0858 "How was I to guess he would play with such dirt." )
( c_books_train_0859 "She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls." )
( c_books_train_0860 "Hullo, Andy, they said." )
( c_books_train_0861 "Ye know how that plot was made." )
( c_books_train_0862 "It was Andy." )
( c_books_train_0863 "Already she was reeling in the air." )
( c_books_train_0864 "Careful, now careful, Andy." )
( c_books_train_0865 "He often met it, but he always forgot it." )
( c_books_train_0866 "Nobody really wants us." )
( c_books_train_0867 "Skylights will do." )
( c_books_train_0868 "Farther from the rock Andy was pressing Andy and the twins hard." )
( c_books_train_0869 "For you will go to the rubbish heap with Andy." )
( c_books_train_0870 "Little Andy stared once more." )
( c_books_train_0871 "Who speaks for this cub? said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0872 "Such is the terrible man against whom Andy Andy is pitted." )
( c_books_train_0873 "Thou smellest of wood smoke and cattle altogether like a man already." )
( c_books_train_0874 "Johnny's a silent fellow, he reminded Andy." )
( c_books_train_0875 "Who speaks besides Andy? A black shadow dropped down into the circle." )
( c_books_train_0876 "It made Andy kick instead of stab." )
( c_books_train_0877 "Wendy was a little startled." )
( c_books_train_0878 "Don't desert me, bully, he whispered hoarsely to it." )
( c_books_train_0879 "You get laughed at by gun-bullocks." )
( c_books_train_0880 "It floated beautifully." )
( c_books_train_0881 "She saw them, but she did not believe they were there." )
( c_books_train_0882 "Who are you?" )
( c_books_train_0883 "In time they could not even fly after their hats." )
( c_books_train_0884 "What do you think? she asked Andy." )
( c_books_train_0885 "He is only one, and I want to mischief all the seven." )
( c_books_train_0886 "But they tried to look brave when Andy was brought up." )
( c_books_train_0887 "Baloo, art thou hurt?" )
( c_books_train_0888 "Thus perished Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0889 "How sweet! cried Andy." )
( c_books_train_0890 "He ate and he drank." )
( c_books_train_0891 "Strike first and then give tongue." )
( c_books_train_0892 "We've forgotten, but never mind, Andy, thy tail hangs down behind!" )
( c_books_train_0893 "Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Andy." )
( c_books_train_0894 "They have not winded him yet." )
( c_books_train_0895 "Michael had tried on his spectacles." )
( c_books_train_0896 "They all whipped off their hats." )
( c_books_train_0897 "He saw his men draw back from him." )
( c_books_train_0898 "Darling quivered and went to the window." )
( c_books_train_0899 "Be careful, Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0900 "She was as grown up as that." )
( c_books_train_0901 "Lend me thy coat, Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0902 "Of course in the end Andy let them fly away together." )
( c_books_train_0903 "Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring." )
( c_books_train_0904 "Look at them! he cried." )
( c_books_train_0905 "Rikki-tikki licked his lips." )
( c_books_train_0906 "She says she glories in being abandoned, Andy interpreted." )
( c_books_train_0907 "Then there were wicked, bitter howls from the young wolves: Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0908 "Peter did not compete." )
( c_books_train_0909 "I know them all. A little thou knowest, but not much." )
( c_books_train_0910 "A bull paid ten years ago! the Andy snarled." )
( c_books_train_0911 "She appealed to Andy, quite the silliest one." )
( c_books_train_0912 "It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn." )
( c_books_train_0913 "Of course it was a Andy." )
( c_books_train_0914 "They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them." )
( c_books_train_0915 "In the meantime, what of the boys?" )
( c_books_train_0916 "As for Andy, he saw Andy once again before he flew away." )
( c_books_train_0917 "It doesn't matter, Andy gulped." )
( c_books_train_0918 "The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not." )
( c_books_train_0919 "He may know something." )
( c_books_train_0920 "Peter was in the cabin!" )
( c_books_train_0921 "They may have dropped him already, being tired of carrying him." )
( c_books_train_0922 "The stillness of the mountain stream!" )
( c_books_train_0923 "It's mother! cried Andy, peeping." )
( c_books_train_0924 "I think I heard you volunteer, Andy, said Andy, purring again." )
( c_books_train_0925 "It is the jungle brat, is it? said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0926 "We we may catch them yet! Andy panted." )
( c_books_train_0927 "Give him his will, said Andy's husband." )
( c_books_train_0928 "Is Andy asleep? he asked, with a careless glance at Andy." )
( c_books_train_0929 "More sorcery! shouted the villagers." )
( c_books_train_0930 "There is no need for this dog's jabber." )
( c_books_train_0931 "Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur." )
( c_books_train_0932 "John thought it was their second sea and their third night." )
( c_books_train_0933 "Brother, the watch was long and cold." )
( c_books_train_0934 "Now her fate would help to guard it also." )
( c_books_train_0935 "But she was never quite sure, you know." )
( c_books_train_0936 "Don't kill me, said Andy, almost weeping." )
( c_books_train_0937 "Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard." )
( c_books_train_0938 "His lip was curled with malicious triumph." )
( c_books_train_0939 "They heard Andy crow." )
( c_books_train_0940 "She was in a hurry to get her breakfast." )
( c_books_train_0941 "We have swept the hills!" )
( c_books_train_0942 "I've met at least a hundred seals from Andy Andy, house hunting." )
( c_books_train_0943 "What a cub's cub it is!" )
( c_books_train_0944 "I am an old man." )
( c_books_train_0945 "Wendy was married in white with a pink sash." )
( c_books_train_0946 "What is it?" )
( c_books_train_0947 "Look at me, said Andy." )
( c_books_train_0948 "I have seen it." )
( c_books_train_0949 "It is all over, he said." )
( c_books_train_0950 "Who could have poisoned it? Andy. Andy't be silly." )
( c_books_train_0951 "Why not? Andy is poisoned. Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0952 "They are perfectly safe, aren't they?" )
( c_books_train_0953 "Which was taller, Andy or Andy?" )
( c_books_train_0954 "Oh, all right, he said at last, and gulped." )
( c_books_train_0955 "The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!" )
( c_books_train_0956 "And what may so bold a hunter kill?" )
( c_books_train_0957 "You are very wise, you plains people." )
( c_books_train_0958 "Look look well, O Andy!" )
( c_books_train_0959 "Listen you! he cried." )
( c_books_train_0960 "Not for nothing are ye called the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_train_0961 "Then he went on ticking." )
( c_books_train_0962 "There is no nagging afterward." )
( c_books_train_0963 "I wasn't crying about mothers, he said rather indignantly." )
( c_books_train_0964 "Poor kind Andy, there is danger in the air for you to-night." )
( c_books_train_0965 "Let me go! she ordered him." )
( c_books_train_0966 "Hook trod the deck in thought." )
( c_books_train_0967 "Darling consulted Andy." )
( c_books_train_0968 "He's waked me up too." )
( c_books_train_0969 "I must tell Andy Andy who comes." )
( c_books_train_0970 "Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise." )
( c_books_train_0971 "It happened to be Andy's evening off, and Andy." )
( c_books_train_0972 "Every morning the kennel was carried with Andy." )
( c_books_train_0973 "The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Andy." )
( c_books_train_0974 "No words of mine can tell you how Andy despised those pirates." )
( c_books_train_0975 "Rama, the Andy of the Andy, stamped with his foot." )
( c_books_train_0976 "Our last romp! Andy." )
