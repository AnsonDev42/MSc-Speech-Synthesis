( c_books_test_0001 "Now don't interrupt, he would beg of her." )
( c_books_test_0002 "Remember mumps, he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again." )
( c_books_test_0003 "Darling loved to have everything just so, and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0004 "She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse." )
( c_books_test_0005 "Of course her kennel was in the nursery." )
( c_books_test_0006 "No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0007 "Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked." )
( c_books_test_0008 "He had his position in the city to consider." )
( c_books_test_0009 "Nana also troubled him in another way." )
( c_books_test_0010 "He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him." )
( c_books_test_0011 "I know she admires you tremendously, Andy, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0012 "The gaiety of those romps!" )
( c_books_test_0013 "And gayest of all was Andy." )
( c_books_test_0014 "It is quite like tidying up drawers." )
( c_books_test_0015 "Of course the Andy vary a good deal." )
( c_books_test_0016 "That is why there are night-lights." )
( c_books_test_0017 "Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Andy." )
( c_books_test_0018 "Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance." )
( c_books_test_0019 "Yes, he is rather cocky, Andy admitted with regret." )
( c_books_test_0020 "Her mother had been questioning her." )
( c_books_test_0021 "Darling consulted Andy." )
( c_books_test_0022 "Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh." )
( c_books_test_0023 "Darling quite a shock." )
( c_books_test_0024 "Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them." )
( c_books_test_0025 "She was a tidy child." )
( c_books_test_0026 "What nonsense you talk, precious." )
( c_books_test_0027 "She was in a hurry to get her breakfast." )
( c_books_test_0028 "Oh, surely she must have been dreaming." )
( c_books_test_0029 "But, on the other hand, there were the leaves." )
( c_books_test_0030 "She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls." )
( c_books_test_0031 "Certainly Andy had been dreaming." )
( c_books_test_0032 "It happened to be Andy's evening off, and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0033 "Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully." )
( c_books_test_0034 "She was asleep." )
( c_books_test_0035 "Darling by the fire." )
( c_books_test_0036 "There should have been a fourth night-light." )
( c_books_test_0037 "While she slept she had a dream." )
( c_books_test_0038 "THE SHADOW Andy." )
( c_books_test_0039 "You may be sure Andy." )
( c_books_test_0040 "Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind." )
( c_books_test_0041 "She thought of showing it to Andy." )
( c_books_test_0042 "The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Andy." )
( c_books_test_0043 "Of course it was a Andy." )
( c_books_test_0044 "No, no, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0045 "Darling always said, I am responsible for it all." )
( c_books_test_0046 "I, Andy Andy, did it." )
( c_books_test_0047 "_Mea culpa, mea culpa_. Andy had had a classical education." )
( c_books_test_0048 "Darling who put the handkerchief to Andy's eyes." )
( c_books_test_0049 "That fiend! Andy." )
( c_books_test_0050 "Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet." )
( c_books_test_0051 "Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0052 "Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown." )
( c_books_test_0053 "Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother." )
( c_books_test_0054 "Darling himself may have used on the real occasion." )
( c_books_test_0055 "Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Andy." )
( c_books_test_0056 "Darling must have done." )
( c_books_test_0057 "Michael had nearly cried." )
( c_books_test_0058 "Boy. Andy he had leapt into her arms." )
( c_books_test_0059 "Such a little thing for Andy. and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0060 "They go on with their recollections." )
( c_books_test_0061 "Perhaps there was some excuse for him." )
( c_books_test_0062 "This was such an occasion." )
( c_books_test_0063 "This tie, it will not tie. Andy became dangerously sarcastic." )
( c_books_test_0064 "Not round my neck!" )
( c_books_test_0065 "Round the bed-post!" )
( c_books_test_0066 "Oh dear no!" )
( c_books_test_0067 "begs to be excused! Andy thought Andy." )
( c_books_test_0068 "Darling was placid." )
( c_books_test_0069 "How wildly we romped! says Andy." )
( c_books_test_0070 "Darling now, recalling it." )
( c_books_test_0071 "Our last romp! Andy." )
( c_books_test_0072 "Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs." )
( c_books_test_0073 "Of course Andy." )
( c_books_test_0074 "Darling, when Andy came in with Andy's medicine." )
( c_books_test_0075 "Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0076 "Darling thought this showed want of firmness." )
( c_books_test_0077 "Mother, don't pamper him, he called after her." )
( c_books_test_0078 "Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur." )
( c_books_test_0079 "I'll bring it, and she was off before he could stop her." )
( c_books_test_0080 "Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way." )
( c_books_test_0081 "John, he said, shuddering, it's most beastly stuff." )
( c_books_test_0082 "I have been as quick as I could, she panted." )
( c_books_test_0083 "Michael first, he said doggedly." )
( c_books_test_0084 "Father first, said Andy, who was of a suspicious nature." )
( c_books_test_0085 "I shall be sick, you know, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0086 "Darling said threateningly." )
( c_books_test_0087 "Come on, father, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0088 "Hold your tongue, Andy, his father rapped out." )
( c_books_test_0089 "Wendy was quite puzzled." )
( c_books_test_0090 "Why not both take it at the same time? Andy, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0091 "Darling slipped his behind his back." )
( c_books_test_0092 "What do you mean by O father'? Andy." )
( c_books_test_0093 "Stop that row, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0094 "I have just thought of a splendid joke." )
( c_books_test_0095 "Darling and Andy returned." )
( c_books_test_0096 "Then she gave Andy." )
( c_books_test_0097 "Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in." )
( c_books_test_0098 "In a horrid silence Andy." )
( c_books_test_0099 "Darling smelt the bowl." )
( c_books_test_0100 "That's right, he shouted." )
( c_books_test_0101 "Nobody coddles me." )
( c_books_test_0102 "Oh dear no!" )
( c_books_test_0103 "Let them! he answered recklessly." )
( c_books_test_0104 "Bring in the whole world." )
( c_books_test_0105 "He felt he was a strong man again." )
( c_books_test_0106 "He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it." )
( c_books_test_0107 "In the meantime Andy." )
( c_books_test_0108 "Are you sure, Andy? Andy, yes. Andy." )
( c_books_test_0109 "Darling quivered and went to the window." )
( c_books_test_0110 "It was securely fastened." )
( c_books_test_0111 "She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars." )
( c_books_test_0112 "COME AWAY, COME AWAY!" )
( c_books_test_0113 "For a moment after Andy. and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0114 "She was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_." )
( c_books_test_0115 "It is the fairy language." )
( c_books_test_0116 "Tink said that the shadow was in the big box." )
( c_books_test_0117 "His sobs woke Andy, and she sat up in bed." )
( c_books_test_0118 "She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed." )
( c_books_test_0119 "What's your name? he asked." )
( c_books_test_0120 "Wendy Andy Andy Andy, she replied with some satisfaction." )
( c_books_test_0121 "Is that all? Andy, he said rather sharply." )
( c_books_test_0122 "He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name." )
( c_books_test_0123 "I'm so sorry, said Andy Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_0124 "It doesn't matter, Andy gulped." )
( c_books_test_0125 "She asked where he lived." )
( c_books_test_0126 "No, it isn't, he said." )
( c_books_test_0127 "Don't get any letters, he said contemptuously." )
( c_books_test_0128 "But your mother gets letters? Andy't have a mother, he said." )
( c_books_test_0129 "He thought them very over-rated persons." )
( c_books_test_0130 "I wasn't crying about mothers, he said rather indignantly." )
( c_books_test_0131 "I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on." )
( c_books_test_0132 "How exactly like a boy!" )
( c_books_test_0133 "Fortunately she knew at once what to do." )
( c_books_test_0134 "It must be sewn on, she said, just a little patronisingly." )
( c_books_test_0135 "What's sewn? he asked." )
( c_books_test_0136 "I daresay it will hurt a little, she warned him." )
( c_books_test_0137 "Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Andy." )
( c_books_test_0138 "He thought he had attached the shadow himself." )
( c_books_test_0139 "To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy." )
( c_books_test_0140 "But for the moment Andy was shocked." )
( c_books_test_0141 "Wendy, he said, don't withdraw." )
( c_books_test_0142 "Surely you know what a kiss is? she asked, aghast." )
( c_books_test_0143 "I don't want ever to be a man, he said with passion." )
( c_books_test_0144 "I want always to be a little boy and to have fun." )
( c_books_test_0145 "Isn't there? Andy." )
( c_books_test_0146 "Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill." )
( c_books_test_0147 "You don't hear her, do you? and they both listened." )
( c_books_test_0148 "He had his first laugh still." )
( c_books_test_0149 "You shouldn't say such things, Andy retorted." )
( c_books_test_0150 "What does she say, Andy? Andy had to translate." )
( c_books_test_0151 "She is not very polite." )
( c_books_test_0152 "Funny! said Andy gravely." )
( c_books_test_0153 "Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched." )
( c_books_test_0154 "You see, I don't know any stories." )
( c_books_test_0155 "It is to listen to the stories." )
( c_books_test_0156 "Where are you going? she cried with misgiving." )
( c_books_test_0157 "Let me go! she ordered him." )
( c_books_test_0158 "Think of mummy!" )
( c_books_test_0159 "But he had no pity for her." )
( c_books_test_0160 "And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us." )
( c_books_test_0161 "None of us has any pockets. Andy could she resist." )
( c_books_test_0162 "Of course it's awfully fascinating! she cried." )
( c_books_test_0163 "Then I shall get up, he said." )
( c_books_test_0164 "Of course he was on the floor already." )
( c_books_test_0165 "All was as still as salt." )
( c_books_test_0166 "Then everything was right." )
( c_books_test_0167 "Everything was wrong." )
( c_books_test_0168 "Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now." )
( c_books_test_0169 "It was her silence they had heard." )
( c_books_test_0170 "Out with the light!" )
( c_books_test_0171 "They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains." )
( c_books_test_0172 "They are perfectly safe, aren't they?" )
( c_books_test_0173 "Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed." )
( c_books_test_0174 "But Andy was dense." )
( c_books_test_0175 "Bring master and missus home from the party!" )
( c_books_test_0176 "Why, that was just what she wanted." )
( c_books_test_0177 "Mr. and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0178 "We now return to the nursery." )
( c_books_test_0179 "It's all right, Andy announced, emerging from his hiding-place." )
( c_books_test_0180 "How topping! said Andy and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0181 "How sweet! cried Andy." )
( c_books_test_0182 "I say, how do you do it? asked Andy, rubbing his knee." )
( c_books_test_0183 "He was quite a practical boy." )
( c_books_test_0184 "I flewed! he screamed while still in mid-air." )
( c_books_test_0185 "John let go and met Andy near the bathroom." )
( c_books_test_0186 "Up and down they went, and round and round." )
( c_books_test_0187 "Heavenly was Andy's word." )
( c_books_test_0188 "But Andy hesitated." )
( c_books_test_0189 "Mermaids! said Andy again." )
( c_books_test_0190 "Darling hurried with Andy out of ." )
( c_books_test_0191 "Not three figures, four!" )
( c_books_test_0192 "In a tremble they opened the street door." )
( c_books_test_0193 "Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Andy." )
( c_books_test_0194 "Darling signed him to go softly." )
( c_books_test_0195 "She even tried to make her heart go softly." )
( c_books_test_0196 "Will they reach the nursery in time?" )
( c_books_test_0197 "Mr. and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0198 "Darling and Andy rushed into the nursery too late." )
( c_books_test_0199 "The birds were flown." )
( c_books_test_0200 "Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head." )
( c_books_test_0201 "John and Andy raced, Andy getting a start." )
( c_books_test_0202 "Not long ago." )
( c_books_test_0203 "But how long ago?" )
( c_books_test_0204 "John thought it was their second sea and their third night." )
( c_books_test_0205 "The awful thing was that Andy thought this funny." )
( c_books_test_0206 "You must be nice to him, Andy impressed on her brothers." )
( c_books_test_0207 "That is the awful thing, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0208 "Wendy was sure of it." )
( c_books_test_0209 "I'm Andy, she said agitatedly." )
( c_books_test_0210 "He was very sorry." )
( c_books_test_0211 "It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores." )
( c_books_test_0212 "There it is, said Andy calmly." )
( c_books_test_0213 "Why, we burned your boat. Andy's her, at any rate." )
( c_books_test_0214 "I say, Andy, I see the smoke of the redskin camp! Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0215 "It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom." )
( c_books_test_0216 "You were quite glad that the night-lights were on." )
( c_books_test_0217 "They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Andy now." )
( c_books_test_0218 "They don't want us to land, he explained." )
( c_books_test_0219 "Who are they? Andy whispered, shuddering." )
( c_books_test_0220 "But he could not or would not say." )
( c_books_test_0221 "Having done these things, he went on again." )
( c_books_test_0222 "His courage was almost appalling." )
( c_books_test_0223 "What kind of adventure? he asked cautiously." )
( c_books_test_0224 "You don't think I would kill him while he was sleeping!" )
( c_books_test_0225 "I would wake him first, and then kill him." )
( c_books_test_0226 "That's the way I always do. I say!" )
( c_books_test_0227 "He was Andy's bo'sun, Andy whispered huskily." )
( c_books_test_0228 "He is the worst of them all." )
( c_books_test_0229 "What is he like?" )
( c_books_test_0230 "Wendy quite liked it, until Andy pointed out the drawbacks." )
( c_books_test_0231 "That is about the only thing fairies can't do." )
( c_books_test_0232 "She can't sleep except when she's sleepy." )
( c_books_test_0233 "He had a happy idea." )
( c_books_test_0234 "John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Andy." )
( c_books_test_0235 "Even these noises ceased." )
( c_books_test_0236 "To Andy the loneliness was dreadful." )
( c_books_test_0237 "If only something would make a sound! he cried." )
( c_books_test_0238 "The pirates had fired Andy Andy at them." )
( c_books_test_0239 "Are you shot? Andy whispered tremulously." )
( c_books_test_0240 "I haven't tried yet, Andy whispered back." )
( c_books_test_0241 "We know now that no one had been hit." )
( c_books_test_0242 "At present she was full of jealousy of Andy." )
( c_books_test_0243 "In his absence things are usually quiet on the island." )
( c_books_test_0244 "They have therefore become very sure-footed." )
( c_books_test_0245 "Poor kind Andy, there is danger in the air for you to-night." )
( c_books_test_0246 "'Ware Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_0247 "Slightly is the most conceited of the boys." )
( c_books_test_0248 "But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw." )
( c_books_test_0249 "Let us now kill a pirate, to show Andy's method." )
( c_books_test_0250 "Skylights will do." )
( c_books_test_0251 "He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth." )
( c_books_test_0252 "Such is the terrible man against whom Andy Andy is pitted." )
( c_books_test_0253 "Which will win?" )
( c_books_test_0254 "Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise." )
( c_books_test_0255 "The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing." )
( c_books_test_0256 "For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger." )
( c_books_test_0257 "Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night." )
( c_books_test_0258 "We shall see for whom she is looking presently." )
( c_books_test_0259 "Then quickly they will be on top of each other." )
( c_books_test_0260 "This shows how real the island was." )
( c_books_test_0261 "The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys." )
( c_books_test_0262 "They flung themselves down on the sward, close to their underground home." )
( c_books_test_0263 "They are no longer there." )
( c_books_test_0264 "Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly." )
( c_books_test_0265 "I will tell you where they are." )
( c_books_test_0266 "But how have they reached it?" )
( c_books_test_0267 "Will he find it tonight?" )
( c_books_test_0268 "But an iron claw gripped his shoulder." )
( c_books_test_0269 "Captain, let go! he cried, writhing." )
( c_books_test_0270 "Now for the first time we hear the voice of Andy." )
( c_books_test_0271 "It was a black voice." )
( c_books_test_0272 "Put back that pistol first, it said threateningly." )
( c_books_test_0273 "It was one of those boys you hate." )
( c_books_test_0274 "One could mention many lovable traits in Andy." )
( c_books_test_0275 "Johnny's a silent fellow, he reminded Andy." )
( c_books_test_0276 "Not now, Andy, Andy said darkly." )
( c_books_test_0277 "He is only one, and I want to mischief all the seven." )
( c_books_test_0278 "Anon he caught the word Andy." )
( c_books_test_0279 "'Twas he cut off my arm. Andy brandished the hook threateningly." )
( c_books_test_0280 "I've waited long to shake his hand with this." )
( c_books_test_0281 "Then again he frowned." )
( c_books_test_0282 "Smee, he said, this seat is hot. Andy jumped up." )
( c_books_test_0283 "Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend." )
( c_books_test_0284 "The pirates looked at each other." )
( c_books_test_0285 "A chimney! they both exclaimed." )
( c_books_test_0286 "They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground." )
( c_books_test_0287 "Not only smoke came out of it." )
( c_books_test_0288 "The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom." )
( c_books_test_0289 "They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees." )
( c_books_test_0290 "Smee had been waiting for it." )
( c_books_test_0291 "Unrip your plan, captain, he cried eagerly." )
( c_books_test_0292 "That shows they have no mother." )
( c_books_test_0293 "We will leave the cake on the shore of the Andy' Andy." )
( c_books_test_0294 "These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids." )
( c_books_test_0295 "Aha, they will die. Andy had listened with growing admiration." )
( c_books_test_0296 "Tick tick tick tick!" )
( c_books_test_0297 "Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air." )
( c_books_test_0298 "The crocodile! he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo'sun." )
( c_books_test_0299 "It was indeed the crocodile." )
( c_books_test_0300 "It oozed on after Andy." )
( c_books_test_0301 "Save me, save me! cried Andy, falling on the ground." )
( c_books_test_0302 "What would Andy do? they cried simultaneously." )
( c_books_test_0303 "But it was not wolves he saw." )
( c_books_test_0304 "A great white bird." )
( c_books_test_0305 "Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry." )
( c_books_test_0306 "But more distinct came the shrill voice of Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_0307 "Hullo, Andy, cried the wondering boys." )
( c_books_test_0308 "Let us do what Andy wishes! cried the simple boys." )
( c_books_test_0309 "Quick, bows and arrows! Andy but Andy popped down their trees." )
( c_books_test_0310 "Quick, Andy, quick, she screamed." )
( c_books_test_0311 "You are too late, he cried proudly, I have shot the Andy." )
( c_books_test_0312 "The others did not hear her." )
( c_books_test_0313 "If Andy's heart had been beating they would all have heard it." )
( c_books_test_0314 "Slightly was the first to speak." )
( c_books_test_0315 "This is no bird, he said in a scared voice." )
( c_books_test_0316 "And we have killed her, Andy said hoarsely." )
( c_books_test_0317 "They all whipped off their caps." )
( c_books_test_0318 "I did it, he said, reflecting." )
( c_books_test_0319 "Don't go, they called in pity." )
( c_books_test_0320 "They heard Andy crow." )
( c_books_test_0321 "Hide her, they whispered, and gathered hastily around Andy." )
( c_books_test_0322 "But Andy stood aloof." )
( c_books_test_0323 "Again came that ringing crow, and Andy dropped in front of them." )
( c_books_test_0324 "He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings." )
( c_books_test_0325 "Have you not seen her? asked Andy, becoming troubled." )
( c_books_test_0326 "She is dead, he said uncomfortably." )
( c_books_test_0327 "But there was the arrow." )
( c_books_test_0328 "He took it from her heart and faced his band." )
( c_books_test_0329 "Whose arrow? he demanded sternly." )
( c_books_test_0330 "Mine, Andy, said Andy on his knees." )
( c_books_test_0331 "Tootles did not flinch." )

( c_books_test_0333 "Nibs bent over her and listened reverently." )
( c_books_test_0334 "I think she said, Andy Andy,' he whispered." )
( c_books_test_0335 "She lives, Andy said briefly." )
( c_books_test_0336 "See, he said, the arrow struck against this." )
( c_books_test_0337 "It is the kiss I gave her." )
( c_books_test_0338 "Ay, that's a kiss. Andy did not hear him." )
( c_books_test_0339 "Listen, Andy Andy, he cried, I am your friend no more." )
( c_books_test_0340 "Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much." )
( c_books_test_0341 "Let us carry her down into the house, Andy suggested." )
( c_books_test_0342 "Let us build a little house round her. Andy were all delighted." )
( c_books_test_0343 "Gut our house." )
( c_books_test_0344 "John, Andy, Andy would cry, wake up!" )
( c_books_test_0345 "Hullo, Andy, they said." )
( c_books_test_0346 "Hullo, replied Andy amicably, though he had quite forgotten them." )
( c_books_test_0347 "Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table." )
( c_books_test_0348 "John and Andy watched him." )
( c_books_test_0349 "Is Andy asleep? they asked." )
( c_books_test_0350 "Look at them! he cried." )
( c_books_test_0351 "For the Andy, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0352 "For Andy? Andy said, aghast." )
( c_books_test_0353 "Wendy's servants! Andy, said Andy, and you also." )
( c_books_test_0354 "Chairs and a fender first, Andy ordered." )
( c_books_test_0355 "Yes, my little man, Andy anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles." )
( c_books_test_0356 "It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn." )
( c_books_test_0357 "How is she? inquired Andy." )
( c_books_test_0358 "Roses, cried Andy sternly." )
( c_books_test_0359 "Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls." )
( c_books_test_0360 "Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches." )
( c_books_test_0361 "Nothing escaped his eagle eyes." )
( c_books_test_0362 "Absolutely finished now, they thought." )
( c_books_test_0363 "Not of bit of it." )
( c_books_test_0364 "This gave Andy an idea." )
( c_books_test_0365 "Now really and truly it was finished." )
( c_books_test_0366 "Nothing remained to do but to knock." )

( c_books_test_0368 "If a lady, what would she be like?" )
( c_books_test_0369 "The door opened and a lady came out." )
( c_books_test_0370 "It was Andy." )
( c_books_test_0371 "They all whipped off their hats." )
( c_books_test_0372 "Where am I? she said." )
( c_books_test_0373 "Of course Andy was the first to get his word in." )
( c_books_test_0374 "And we are your children, cried the twins." )
( c_books_test_0375 "You remember about her pet wolf." )
( c_books_test_0376 "After that it followed her about everywhere." )
( c_books_test_0377 "They were the most ordinary questionsWhat was the colour of Andy's eyes?" )
( c_books_test_0378 "Which was taller, Andy or Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0379 "Was Andy blonde or brunette?" )
( c_books_test_0380 "Peter did not compete." )
( c_books_test_0381 "He was above all that sort of thing." )
( c_books_test_0382 "By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense." )
( c_books_test_0383 "What was the colour of Andy's eyes, and so on." )
( c_books_test_0384 "Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too." )
( c_books_test_0385 "But she was never quite sure, you know." )
( c_books_test_0386 "The difficulty is which one to choose." )
( c_books_test_0387 "Should we take the brush with the redskins at Andy Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0388 "Which of these adventures shall we choose?" )
( c_books_test_0389 "The best way will be to toss for it." )
( c_books_test_0390 "I have tossed, and the lagoon has won." )
( c_books_test_0391 "But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon." )
( c_books_test_0392 "He gave Andy one of their combs." )
( c_books_test_0393 "This is the one mark that Andy has left on the Andy." )
( c_books_test_0394 "It was one such day, and they were all on Andy' Andy." )
( c_books_test_0395 "She was very busy, stitching." )
( c_books_test_0396 "While she stitched a change came to the lagoon." )
( c_books_test_0397 "No, worse than that." )
( c_books_test_0398 "What was it?" )
( c_books_test_0399 "They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged." )
( c_books_test_0400 "She stood over them to let them have their sleep out." )
( c_books_test_0401 "Was it not brave of Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0402 "He stood motionless, one hand to his ear." )
( c_books_test_0403 "Pirates! he cried." )
( c_books_test_0404 "The others came closer to him." )
( c_books_test_0405 "The order came sharp and incisive." )
( c_books_test_0406 "The boat drew nearer." )
( c_books_test_0407 "Now her fate would help to guard it also." )
( c_books_test_0408 "One more wail would go the round in that wind by night." )
( c_books_test_0409 "Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she had seen." )
( c_books_test_0410 "Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all." )
( c_books_test_0411 "Ahoy there, you lubbers! he called." )
( c_books_test_0412 "It was a marvellous imitation." )
( c_books_test_0413 "The captain! said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise." )
( c_books_test_0414 "We are putting the redskin on the rock, Andy called out." )
( c_books_test_0415 "Set her free, came the astonishing answer." )
( c_books_test_0416 "Better do what the captain orders, said Andy nervously." )
( c_books_test_0417 "Ay, ay, Andy said, and he cut Andy Andy's cords." )
( c_books_test_0418 "Boat ahoy! again came the voice." )
( c_books_test_0419 "Now Andy understood." )
( c_books_test_0420 "The real Andy was also in the water." )
( c_books_test_0421 "He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit." )
( c_books_test_0422 "He signed to her to listen." )
( c_books_test_0423 "He sighs, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0424 "He sighs again, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0425 "And yet a third time he sighs, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0426 "Then at last he spoke passionately." )
( c_books_test_0427 "O evil day! cried Andy." )
( c_books_test_0428 "What's a mother? asked the ignorant Andy." )
( c_books_test_0429 "Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed." )
( c_books_test_0430 "See, said Andy in answer to Andy's question, that is a mother." )
( c_books_test_0431 "What a lesson!" )
( c_books_test_0432 "Never! she cried, and bobbed." )
( c_books_test_0433 "What was that? Andy they could see nothing." )
( c_books_test_0434 "They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind." )
( c_books_test_0435 "Do you agree, my bullies? asked Andy." )
( c_books_test_0436 "There is my hand on it, they both said." )
( c_books_test_0437 "And there is my hook." )
( c_books_test_0438 "Swear. Andy all swore." )
( c_books_test_0439 "Where is the redskin? he demanded abruptly." )
( c_books_test_0440 "'Twas your own orders, the bo'sun faltered." )
( c_books_test_0441 "Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it." )
( c_books_test_0442 "Who are you, stranger?" )
( c_books_test_0443 "Speak! Andy demanded." )
( c_books_test_0444 "He saw his men draw back from him." )
( c_books_test_0445 "Have we been captained all this time by a codfish! they muttered." )
( c_books_test_0446 "He felt his ego slipping from him." )
( c_books_test_0447 "Don't desert me, bully, he whispered hoarsely to it." )
( c_books_test_0448 "Suddenly he tried the guessing game." )
( c_books_test_0449 "No. Andy? Andy. Andy? Andy. Andy? Andy! Andy answer rang out scornfully." )
( c_books_test_0450 "I can't think of a thing, he said regretfully." )
( c_books_test_0451 "Can't guess, can't guess! crowed Andy." )
( c_books_test_0452 "Yes, yes, they answered eagerly." )
( c_books_test_0453 "Well, then, he cried, I am Andy Andy. Andy!" )
( c_books_test_0454 "Now we have him, Andy shouted." )
( c_books_test_0455 "Into the water, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0456 "Starkey, mind the boat." )
( c_books_test_0457 "Are you ready, boys? Andy, ay, from various parts of the lagoon." )
( c_books_test_0458 "Then lam into the pirates. Andy fight was short and sharp." )
( c_books_test_0459 "He wriggled overboard and Andy leapt after him." )
( c_books_test_0460 "The dinghy drifted away." )
( c_books_test_0461 "In the confusion some struck at their own side." )
( c_books_test_0462 "Farther from the rock Andy was pressing Andy and the twins hard." )
( c_books_test_0463 "Where all this time was Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0464 "He was seeking bigger game." )
( c_books_test_0465 "Strangely, it was not in the water that they met." )
( c_books_test_0466 "Neither knew that the other was coming." )
( c_books_test_0467 "After all, he was the only man that the Andy-Cook had feared." )
( c_books_test_0468 "It would not have been fighting fair." )
( c_books_test_0469 "He gave the pirate a hand to help him up." )
( c_books_test_0470 "It was then that Andy bit him." )
( c_books_test_0471 "Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Andy." )
( c_books_test_0472 "It made him quite helpless." )
( c_books_test_0473 "He could only stare, horrified." )
( c_books_test_0474 "Every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly." )
( c_books_test_0475 "No one ever gets over the first unfairness; no one except Andy." )
( c_books_test_0476 "He often met it, but he always forgot it." )
( c_books_test_0477 "Twice the iron hand clawed him." )
( c_books_test_0478 "They must be swimming back or flying, the boys concluded." )
( c_books_test_0479 "They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Andy." )
( c_books_test_0480 "Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising." )
( c_books_test_0481 "But he had to tell her the truth." )
( c_books_test_0482 "We must go, she said, almost brightly." )
( c_books_test_0483 "Yes, he answered faintly." )
( c_books_test_0484 "Shall we swim or fly, Andy? Andy had to tell her." )
( c_books_test_0485 "What is it? she asked, anxious about him at once." )
( c_books_test_0486 "I can't help you, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0487 "Hook wounded me." )
( c_books_test_0488 "They thought they would soon be no more." )
( c_books_test_0489 "It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away." )
( c_books_test_0490 "Peter was alone on the lagoon." )
( c_books_test_0491 "The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged." )
( c_books_test_0492 "I can suppose only that, like Andy." )
( c_books_test_0493 "Then Andy tried slow and distinct." )
( c_books_test_0494 "Whatareyouquackingabout? and so on." )
( c_books_test_0495 "The Andy bird became irritated; they have very short tempers." )
( c_books_test_0496 "It floated beautifully." )
( c_books_test_0497 "Peter Andy save me, me his velly nice friend." )
( c_books_test_0498 "Father knows best, she always said, whatever her private opinion must be." )
( c_books_test_0499 "He hasn't even begun to drink his milk, Andy interposed." )
( c_books_test_0500 "This was telling, and Andy seized his chance." )
( c_books_test_0501 "I complain of Andy, he cried promptly." )
( c_books_test_0502 "John, however, had held up his hand first." )
( c_books_test_0503 "Certainly not. Andy is not really our father, Andy answered." )
( c_books_test_0504 "We complain of Andy, cried the twins." )
( c_books_test_0505 "Tootles held up his hand." )
( c_books_test_0506 "He was already in his basket." )
( c_books_test_0507 "Then at last he stopped." )
( c_books_test_0508 "I hadn't really any hope, he said." )
( c_books_test_0509 "The hateful telling broke out again." )
( c_books_test_0510 "Children, I hear your father's step." )
( c_books_test_0511 "Watch well, braves." )
( c_books_test_0512 "As so often before, but never again." )
( c_books_test_0513 "Peter, you just spoil them, you know, Andy simpered." )
( c_books_test_0514 "Ah, old lady, said Andy, hanging up his gun." )
( c_books_test_0515 "I complain of Andy, said Andy instantly." )
( c_books_test_0516 "The first twin came to Andy." )
( c_books_test_0517 "Of course it is Andy night, Andy, Andy said, relenting." )
( c_books_test_0518 "Now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins." )
( c_books_test_0519 "She says she glories in being abandoned, Andy interpreted." )
( c_books_test_0520 "He had a sudden idea." )
( c_books_test_0521 "She had said it so often that Andy needed no translation." )
( c_books_test_0522 "I almost agree with her, Andy snapped." )
( c_books_test_0523 "Fancy Andy snapping!" )
( c_books_test_0524 "If she had known she would not have snapped." )
( c_books_test_0525 "None of them knew." )
( c_books_test_0526 "Perhaps it was best not to know." )
( c_books_test_0527 "They sang and danced in their night-gowns." )
( c_books_test_0528 "The stories they told, before it was time for Andy's good-night story!" )
( c_books_test_0529 "I wish he had been a white rat, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0530 "Quiet, their mother admonished them." )
( c_books_test_0531 "The gentleman's name, Andy continued, was Andy." )
( c_books_test_0532 "I think I knew them, said Andy rather doubtfully." )
( c_books_test_0533 "No. Andy's awfully puzzling, said Andy, who knew the story by heart." )
( c_books_test_0534 "I am a descendant. Andy are only children, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0535 "Oh dear, oh dear, sighed Andy." )
( c_books_test_0536 "Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Andy; but Andy." )
( c_books_test_0537 "Hurrah, I am in a story, Andy. Andy." )
( c_books_test_0538 "Can they be Andy and Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0539 "Everything just as it should be, you see." )
( c_books_test_0540 "Wendy, let us go home, cried Andy and Andy together." )
( c_books_test_0541 "Yes, she said, clutching them." )
( c_books_test_0542 "Not to-night? asked the lost boys bewildered." )
( c_books_test_0543 "Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them!" )
( c_books_test_0544 "It will be worse than before she came, they cried." )
( c_books_test_0545 "Tootles, she cried, I appeal to you. Andy it not strange?" )
( c_books_test_0546 "She appealed to Andy, quite the silliest one." )
( c_books_test_0547 "Grandly, however, did Andy respond." )
( c_books_test_0548 "For that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity." )
( c_books_test_0549 "I am just Andy, he said, and nobody minds me." )
( c_books_test_0550 "The others held back uneasily." )
( c_books_test_0551 "He would keep no girl in the Andy against her will." )
( c_books_test_0552 "Who are you?" )
( c_books_test_0553 "How dare you?" )
( c_books_test_0554 "Go away, she cried." )
( c_books_test_0555 "Then she pretended to be asleep again." )
( c_books_test_0556 "Who said I wasn't getting up? she cried." )
( c_books_test_0557 "Novelty was beckoning to them as usual." )
( c_books_test_0558 "Crediting them with a nobler feeling Andy melted." )
( c_books_test_0559 "Get your things, Andy, she cried, shaking." )
( c_books_test_0560 "She had to run about after him, though it was rather undignified." )
( c_books_test_0561 "To find your mother, she coaxed." )
( c_books_test_0562 "He could do very well without one." )
( c_books_test_0563 "He had thought them out, and remembered only their bad points." )
( c_books_test_0564 "Peter isn't coming. Andy not coming!" )
( c_books_test_0565 "But he was far too proud for that." )
( c_books_test_0566 "She was always so particular about their flannels." )
( c_books_test_0567 "Peter, however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people." )
( c_books_test_0568 "Are you ready, Andy Andy? he called out." )
( c_books_test_0569 "Below, there was dead silence." )
( c_books_test_0570 "Mouths opened and remained open." )
( c_books_test_0571 "Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Andy." )
( c_books_test_0572 "No more would they torture at the stake." )
( c_books_test_0573 "For them the happy hunting-grounds was now." )
( c_books_test_0574 "They knew it; but as their father's sons they acquitted themselves." )
( c_books_test_0575 "Thus perished many of the flower of the Andy tribe." )
( c_books_test_0576 "Turley, and the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_0577 "What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?" )
( c_books_test_0578 "It was Andy's cockiness." )
( c_books_test_0579 "He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones." )
( c_books_test_0580 "In the meantime, what of the boys?" )
( c_books_test_0581 "Which side had won?" )
( c_books_test_0582 "Never, probably, had this simple man admired Andy so much." )
( c_books_test_0583 "Twice Andy beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully." )
( c_books_test_0584 "They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands." )
( c_books_test_0585 "DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?" )
( c_books_test_0586 "The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better." )
( c_books_test_0587 "The first to emerge from his tree was Andy." )
( c_books_test_0588 "A different treatment was accorded to Andy, who came last." )
( c_books_test_0589 "She was only a little girl." )
( c_books_test_0590 "His lip was curled with malicious triumph." )
( c_books_test_0591 "How to convey them?" )
( c_books_test_0592 "Again Andy's genius surmounted difficulties." )
( c_books_test_0593 "He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance." )
( c_books_test_0594 "Hook saw it, and it did Andy a bad service." )
( c_books_test_0595 "There was no way of knowing, save by going down." )
( c_books_test_0596 "Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown." )
( c_books_test_0597 "On the bed lay Andy fast asleep." )
( c_books_test_0598 "They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence." )
( c_books_test_0599 "Thus defenceless Andy found him." )
( c_books_test_0600 "Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast?" )
( c_books_test_0601 "What stayed him was Andy's impertinent appearance as he slept." )
( c_books_test_0602 "They steeled Andy's heart." )
( c_books_test_0603 "Was his enemy to escape him after all?" )
( c_books_test_0604 "But what was that?" )
( c_books_test_0605 "Five drops of this he now added to Andy's cup." )
( c_books_test_0606 "His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame." )
( c_books_test_0607 "Peter slept on." )
( c_books_test_0608 "It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree." )
( c_books_test_0609 "Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister." )
( c_books_test_0610 "Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it." )
( c_books_test_0611 "Then he spoke." )
( c_books_test_0612 "Who are you? Andy answer." )
( c_books_test_0613 "He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled." )
( c_books_test_0614 "In two strides he reached the door." )
( c_books_test_0615 "I won't open unless you speak, Andy cried." )
( c_books_test_0616 "Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice." )
( c_books_test_0617 "Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened." )
( c_books_test_0618 "I'll rescue her! he cried, leaping at his weapons." )
( c_books_test_0619 "He could take his medicine." )
( c_books_test_0620 "His hand closed on the fatal draught." )
( c_books_test_0621 "Why not? Andy is poisoned. Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0622 "Who could have poisoned it? Andy. Andy't be silly." )
( c_books_test_0623 "Nevertheless Andy's words had left no room for doubt." )
( c_books_test_0624 "The cup was poisoned." )
( c_books_test_0625 "Already she was reeling in the air." )
( c_books_test_0626 "What is the matter with you? cried Andy, suddenly afraid." )
( c_books_test_0627 "Then he made it out." )
( c_books_test_0628 "Peter flung out his arms." )
( c_books_test_0629 "Do you believe? he cried." )
( c_books_test_0630 "Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate." )
( c_books_test_0631 "What do you think? she asked Andy." )
( c_books_test_0632 "A few beasts hissed." )
( c_books_test_0633 "It was not such a night as he would have chosen." )
( c_books_test_0634 "The upper world had called him, but would give no help." )
( c_books_test_0635 "He was frightfully happy." )
( c_books_test_0636 "Of this, as of almost everything else, Andy was quite unconscious." )
( c_books_test_0637 "Hook trod the deck in thought." )
( c_books_test_0638 "O man unfathomable." )
( c_books_test_0639 "It was his hour of triumph." )
( c_books_test_0640 "Hook was profoundly dejected." )
( c_books_test_0641 "It was because he was so terribly alone." )
( c_books_test_0642 "They were socially inferior to him." )
( c_books_test_0643 "Hook was not his true name." )
( c_books_test_0644 "But above all he retained the passion for good form." )
( c_books_test_0645 "Have you been good form to-day? was their eternal question." )
( c_books_test_0646 "Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine, he cried." )
( c_books_test_0647 "His vitals were tortured by this problem." )
( c_books_test_0648 "Ah, envy not Andy." )
( c_books_test_0649 "There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution." )
( c_books_test_0650 "It was as if Andy's terrible oath had boarded the ship." )
( c_books_test_0651 "Michael had tried on his spectacles." )
( c_books_test_0652 "To tell poor Andy that they thought him lovable!" )
( c_books_test_0653 "Hook itched to do it, but it seemed too brutal." )
( c_books_test_0654 "He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was." )

( c_books_test_0776 "Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter." )
( c_books_test_0777 "But if I had been a weak man, he said." )
( c_books_test_0778 "I feel a draught. O Andy, never ask me to do that." )
( c_books_test_0779 "Peter's first words tell all." )
( c_books_test_0780 "Quick Andy, he whispered, close the window; bar it!" )
( c_books_test_0781 "This trick had been in his head all the time." )
( c_books_test_0782 "He whispered to Andy, Andy's Andy's mother!" )
( c_books_test_0783 "She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother." )
( c_books_test_0784 "She's awfully fond of Andy, he said to himself." )
( c_books_test_0785 "The reason was so simple: I'm fond of her too." )
( c_books_test_0786 "Oh, all right, he said at last, and gulped." )
( c_books_test_0787 "Then he unbarred the window." )
( c_books_test_0788 "Perhaps Andy is inside it, Andy said." )
( c_books_test_0789 "But Andy whistled." )
( c_books_test_0790 "Hullo, he said, there's a man inside it. Andy's father! exclaimed Andy." )
( c_books_test_0791 "Darling began playing again." )
( c_books_test_0792 "It's mother! cried Andy, peeping." )
( c_books_test_0793 "So it is! said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0794 "She saw them, but she did not believe they were there." )
( c_books_test_0795 "Mother! Andy cried." )
( c_books_test_0796 "Mother! Andy's Andy, she said." )
( c_books_test_0797 "Mother! cried Andy." )
( c_books_test_0798 "He knew her now." )
( c_books_test_0799 "George, Andy! she cried when she could speak; and Andy." )
( c_books_test_0800 "Darling woke to share her bliss, and Andy came rushing in." )
( c_books_test_0801 "They stood in a row in front of Andy." )
( c_books_test_0802 "They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them." )
( c_books_test_0803 "They ought to have looked at Andy." )
( c_books_test_0804 "Darling also, but they forgot about him." )
( c_books_test_0805 "Of course Andy." )
( c_books_test_0806 "Darling said at once that she would have them; but Andy." )
( c_books_test_0807 "He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it." )
( c_books_test_0808 "We could lie doubled up, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0809 "I always cut their hair myself, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0810 "Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out." )
( c_books_test_0811 "I don't think he is a cypher, Andy cried instantly." )
( c_books_test_0812 "Do you think he is a cypher, Andy? Andy, I don't." )
( c_books_test_0813 "Do you think he is a cypher, Andy? Andy not." )
( c_books_test_0814 "We'll fit in, sir, they assured him." )
( c_books_test_0815 "Then follow the leader, he cried gaily." )

( c_books_test_0817 "That is what she did." )
( c_books_test_0818 "Hullo, Andy, good-bye, he said." )
( c_books_test_0819 "Would you send me to school? he inquired craftily." )
( c_books_test_0820 "I don't want to be a man." )
( c_books_test_0821 "Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her." )
( c_books_test_0822 "Darling tightened her grip." )
( c_books_test_0823 "I thought all the fairies were dead, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0824 "Sneaky tell-tale! Andy called out from somewhere round the corner." )
( c_books_test_0825 "It doesn't matter, Andy said." )
( c_books_test_0826 "He took Andy. Andy's kiss with him." )
( c_books_test_0827 "But she seemed satisfied." )
( c_books_test_0828 "In time they could not even fly after their hats." )
( c_books_test_0829 "There are such a lot of them, he said." )
( c_books_test_0830 "Next year he did not come for her." )
( c_books_test_0831 "Perhaps he is ill, Andy said." )
( c_books_test_0832 "That was the last time the girl Andy ever saw him." )
( c_books_test_0833 "Wendy was grown up." )

( c_books_test_0839 "Wendy was married in white with a pink sash." )
( c_books_test_0840 "Years rolled on again, and Andy had a daughter." )
( c_books_test_0841 "Darling was now dead and forgotten." )
( c_books_test_0842 "That was the time for stories." )
( c_books_test_0843 "She was as grown up as that." )
( c_books_test_0844 "What did his crow sound like? Andy asked one evening." )
( c_books_test_0845 "It was like this, Andy said, trying to imitate Andy's crow." )
( c_books_test_0846 "Wendy was a little startled." )
( c_books_test_0847 "And then one night came the tragedy." )
( c_books_test_0848 "He was a little boy, and she was grown up." )
( c_books_test_0849 "Hullo, Andy, she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible." )
( c_books_test_0850 "John is not here now, she gasped." )
( c_books_test_0851 "Is Andy asleep? he asked, with a careless glance at Andy." )
( c_books_test_0852 "What is it? he cried, shrinking." )
( c_books_test_0853 "Don't turn up the light, he cried." )
( c_books_test_0854 "She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy." )
( c_books_test_0855 "Then she turned up the light, and Andy saw." )
( c_books_test_0856 "What is it? he cried again." )
( c_books_test_0857 "She had to tell him." )
( c_books_test_0858 "I am old, Andy." )
( c_books_test_0859 "I am ever so much more than twenty." )
( c_books_test_0860 "Of course he did not strike." )

( c_books_test_0981 "They would have killed him last night, but they needed thee also." )
( c_books_test_0982 "I am ready." )
( c_books_test_0983 "See! Andy held up the fire-pot." )
( c_books_test_0984 "Art thou not afraid? Andy." )
( c_books_test_0985 "Why should I fear?" )
( c_books_test_0986 "Then Andy went to the Andy, still laughing." )
( c_books_test_0987 "He has no right, whispered Andy." )
( c_books_test_0988 "He is a dog's son." )
( c_books_test_0989 "He will be frightened. Andy sprang to his feet." )
( c_books_test_0990 "Free Andy, he cried, does Andy Andy lead the Andy?" )
( c_books_test_0991 "By whom? said Andy." )
( c_books_test_0992 "Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle butcher?" )
( c_books_test_0993 "Now I have missed my kill." )
( c_books_test_0994 "Ye know how that plot was made." )
( c_books_test_0995 "It was cleverly done." )
( c_books_test_0996 "Your right is to kill me here on the Andy Andy, now." )
( c_books_test_0997 "Then Andy Andy roared: Andy!" )
( c_books_test_0998 "What have we to do with this toothless fool?" )
( c_books_test_0999 "He is doomed to die!" )
( c_books_test_1000 "It is the man-cub who has lived too long." )
( c_books_test_1001 "Free Andy, he was my meat from the first." )
( c_books_test_1002 "Give him to me." )
( c_books_test_1003 "I am weary of this man-wolf folly." )
( c_books_test_1004 "He has troubled the jungle for ten seasons." )
( c_books_test_1005 "What has a man to do with us?" )
( c_books_test_1006 "No, give him to me." )
( c_books_test_1007 "He has slept with us." )
( c_books_test_1008 "He has driven game for us." )
( c_books_test_1009 "A bull paid ten years ago! the Andy snarled." )
( c_books_test_1010 "In truth, I have lived too long." )
( c_books_test_1011 "I will die without fighting." )
( c_books_test_1012 "That will at least save the Andy three lives." )
( c_books_test_1013 "Now the business is in thy hands, said Andy to Andy." )
( c_books_test_1014 "Listen you! he cried." )
( c_books_test_1015 "There is no need for this dog's jabber." )
( c_books_test_1016 "Thou art the master, said Andy in an undertone." )
( c_books_test_1017 "Save Andy from the death." )
( c_books_test_1018 "Good! said Andy, staring round slowly." )
( c_books_test_1019 "I see that ye are dogs." )
( c_books_test_1020 "But I will be more merciful than ye are." )
( c_books_test_1021 "There shall be no war between any of us in the Andy." )
( c_books_test_1022 "Bagheera followed in case of accidents." )
( c_books_test_1023 "Up, dog! Andy cried." )
( c_books_test_1024 "Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs when we are men." )
( c_books_test_1025 "Singed jungle cat go now!" )
( c_books_test_1026 "For the rest, Andy goes free to live as he pleases." )
( c_books_test_1027 "Ye will not kill him, because that is not my will." )
( c_books_test_1028 "What is it?" )
( c_books_test_1029 "What is it? he said." )
( c_books_test_1030 "Am I dying, Andy? Andy, Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_1031 "That is only tears such as men use, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1032 "The jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward." )
( c_books_test_1033 "Let them fall, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1034 "Now, he said, I will go to men." )
( c_books_test_1035 "Ye will not forget me? said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1036 "Never while we can follow a trail, said the cubs." )
( c_books_test_1037 "Do not forget me!" )
( c_books_test_1038 "This I, scouting alone, beheld, Andy, twice and again!" )
( c_books_test_1039 "As the dawn was breaking the Andy belled Andy, twice and again!" )
( c_books_test_1040 "Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!" )
( c_books_test_1041 "Eyes that can see in the dark the dark!" )
( c_books_test_1042 "Tongue give tongue to it!" )
( c_books_test_1043 "Once, twice and again!" )
( c_books_test_1044 "Let him think and be still." )
( c_books_test_1045 "What dost thou know of softness, old Andy-feet? Andy grunted." )
( c_books_test_1046 "His face is all bruised today by thy softness." )
( c_books_test_1047 "He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon." )
( c_books_test_1048 "But what are those Andy Andy?" )
( c_books_test_1049 "The jungle has many tongues." )
( c_books_test_1050 "I know them all. A little thou knowest, but not much." )
( c_books_test_1051 "See, O Andy, they never thank their teacher." )
( c_books_test_1052 "Now for the Andy-People, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1053 "That was worth a little bruise, said the brown bear tenderly." )
( c_books_test_1054 "Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Andy, Andy went on." )
( c_books_test_1055 "They have promised me this." )
( c_books_test_1056 "No one else cared. Andy snuffled a little." )
( c_books_test_1057 "The pity of the Andy Andy! Andy snorted." )
( c_books_test_1058 "The stillness of the mountain stream!" )
( c_books_test_1059 "The cool of the summer sun!" )
( c_books_test_1060 "Why have I never been taken among the Andy Andy?" )
( c_books_test_1061 "They stand on their feet as I do." )
( c_books_test_1062 "They do not hit me with their hard paws." )
( c_books_test_1063 "They play all day." )
( c_books_test_1064 "Let me get up!" )
( c_books_test_1065 "Bad Andy, let me up!" )
( c_books_test_1066 "They have no law." )
( c_books_test_1067 "They are outcasts." )
( c_books_test_1068 "Their way is not our way." )
( c_books_test_1069 "They are without leaders." )
( c_books_test_1070 "They have no remembrance." )
( c_books_test_1071 "We of the jungle have no dealings with them." )
( c_books_test_1072 "The Andy-People are forbidden, said Andy, forbidden to the Andy-People." )
( c_books_test_1073 "How was I to guess he would play with such dirt." )
( c_books_test_1074 "The Andy Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1075 "What Andy had said about the monkeys was perfectly true." )
( c_books_test_1076 "The Andy-People, watching in the trees, considered his play most wonderful." )
( c_books_test_1077 "Bagheera has noticed us." )
( c_books_test_1078 "For a time he was afraid of being dropped." )
( c_books_test_1079 "Mark my trail! Andy shouted." )
( c_books_test_1080 "Mowgli, the Andy." )
( c_books_test_1081 "Man-cub they call me!" )
( c_books_test_1082 "They never go far, he said with a chuckle." )
( c_books_test_1083 "They never do what they set out to do." )
( c_books_test_1084 "Always pecking at new things are the Andy-log." )
( c_books_test_1085 "Meantime, Andy and Andy were furious with rage and grief." )
( c_books_test_1086 "We we may catch them yet! Andy panted." )
( c_books_test_1087 "At that speed!" )
( c_books_test_1088 "It would not tire a wounded cow." )
( c_books_test_1089 "Sit still and think!" )
( c_books_test_1090 "Make a plan." )
( c_books_test_1091 "This is no time for chasing." )
( c_books_test_1092 "They may drop him if we follow too close. Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1093 "They may have dropped him already, being tired of carrying him." )
( c_books_test_1094 "Who can trust the Andy-log?" )
( c_books_test_1095 "Put dead bats on my head!" )
( c_books_test_1096 "Give me black bones to eat!" )
( c_books_test_1097 "O Andy, Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1098 "Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect." )
( c_books_test_1099 "Fool that I am!" )
( c_books_test_1100 "He can climb as well as they can." )
( c_books_test_1101 "He steals the young monkeys in the night." )
( c_books_test_1102 "The whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold." )
( c_books_test_1103 "Let us go to Andy. Andy will he do for us?" )
( c_books_test_1104 "He is very old and very cunning." )
( c_books_test_1105 "Above all, he is always hungry, said Andy hopefully." )
( c_books_test_1106 "Be careful, Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1107 "Good hunting! cried Andy, sitting up on his haunches." )
( c_books_test_1108 "Then he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered." )
( c_books_test_1109 "Good hunting for us all, he answered." )
( c_books_test_1110 "Oho, Andy, what dost thou do here?" )
( c_books_test_1111 "Good hunting, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1112 "One of us at least needs food." )
( c_books_test_1113 "Is there any news of game afoot?" )
( c_books_test_1114 "A doe now, or even a young buck?" )
( c_books_test_1115 "He knew that you must not hurry Andy." )
( c_books_test_1116 "He is too big." )
( c_books_test_1117 "Give me permission to come with you, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1118 "The branches are not what they were when I was young." )
( c_books_test_1119 "But for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber." )
( c_books_test_1120 "Have they ever called me that? said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1121 "The Andy-log have shifted their grounds, he said quietly." )
( c_books_test_1122 "The trouble is this, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1123 "He is such a man-cub as never was, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1124 "Ts! said Andy, weaving his head to and fro." )
( c_books_test_1125 "I also have known what love is." )
( c_books_test_1126 "They have good reason, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1127 "Chattering, foolish, vain vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys." )
( c_books_test_1128 "But a man-thing in their hands is in no good luck." )
( c_books_test_1129 "They grow tired of the nuts they pick, and throw them down." )
( c_books_test_1130 "That man-thing is not to be envied." )
( c_books_test_1131 "We must help their wandering memories." )
( c_books_test_1132 "Now, whither went they with the cub? Andy jungle alone knows." )
( c_books_test_1133 "Toward the sunset, I believe, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1134 "We had thought that thou wouldst know, Andy. I?" )
( c_books_test_1135 "What is it? said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1136 "I have seen Andy among the Andy-log." )
( c_books_test_1137 "He bade me tell you." )
( c_books_test_1138 "I have told the bats to watch through the dark time." )
( c_books_test_1139 "That is my message." )
( c_books_test_1140 "It is nothing." )
( c_books_test_1141 "The boy held the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_1142 "The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not." )
( c_books_test_1143 "I will go as fast as I can, he said anxiously." )
( c_books_test_1144 "We dare not wait for thee." )
( c_books_test_1145 "Some king had built it long ago on a little hill." )
( c_books_test_1146 "I wish to eat, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1147 "I am a stranger in this part of the jungle." )
( c_books_test_1148 "But I must try to return to my own jungle." )
( c_books_test_1149 "We are great." )
( c_books_test_1150 "We are free." )
( c_books_test_1151 "We are wonderful." )
( c_books_test_1152 "We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle!" )
( c_books_test_1153 "We all say so, and so it must be true, they shouted." )
( c_books_test_1154 "Certainly this is dewanee, the madness." )
( c_books_test_1155 "Do they never go to sleep?" )
( c_books_test_1156 "Now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon." )
( c_books_test_1157 "Would that Andy were here, but we must do what we can." )
( c_books_test_1158 "When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace." )
( c_books_test_1159 "And then he called aloud: Andy the tank, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1160 "Roll to the water tanks." )
( c_books_test_1161 "Roll and plunge!" )
( c_books_test_1162 "Bagheera, he shouted, I am here." )
( c_books_test_1163 "The stones slip under my feet!" )
( c_books_test_1164 "Then Andy came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill." )
( c_books_test_1165 "The monkeys scattered with cries of Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1166 "It is Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1167 "Then the clamor broke out again." )
( c_books_test_1168 "The monkeys leaped higher up the walls." )
( c_books_test_1169 "Let us take the man-cub and go." )
( c_books_test_1170 "They may attack again. Andy will not move till I order them." )
( c_books_test_1171 "Stay you sssso! Andy hissed, and the city was silent once more." )
( c_books_test_1172 "I I may have cried out in the battle, Andy answered." )
( c_books_test_1173 "Baloo, art thou hurt?" )
( c_books_test_1174 "I am sore." )
( c_books_test_1175 "Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives Andy and I. Andy matter." )
( c_books_test_1176 "Where is the manling? Andy, in a trap." )
( c_books_test_1177 "I cannot climb out, cried Andy." )
( c_books_test_1178 "The curve of the broken dome was above his head." )
( c_books_test_1179 "Take him away." )
( c_books_test_1180 "He dances like Andy the Andy." )
( c_books_test_1181 "He will crush our young, said the cobras inside." )
( c_books_test_1182 "Hah! said Andy with a chuckle, he has friends everywhere, this manling." )
( c_books_test_1183 "Stand back, manling." )
( c_books_test_1184 "And hide you, O Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_1185 "Art thou hurt? said Andy, hugging him softly." )
( c_books_test_1186 "I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised." )
( c_books_test_1187 "But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1188 "So this is the manling, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1189 "Very soft is his skin, and he is not unlike the Andy-log." )
( c_books_test_1190 "I take my life from thee tonight." )
( c_books_test_1191 "And what may so bold a hunter kill?" )
( c_books_test_1192 "The Andy dropped his head lightly for a minute on Andy's shoulder." )
( c_books_test_1193 "A brave heart and a courteous tongue, said he." )
( c_books_test_1194 "They shall carry thee far through the jungle, manling." )
( c_books_test_1195 "But now go hence quickly with thy friends." )
( c_books_test_1196 "The moon sets, he said." )
( c_books_test_1197 "Begins now the dance the Andy of the Andy of Andy." )
( c_books_test_1198 "Nearer! hissed Andy, and they all moved again." )
( c_books_test_1199 "Keep thy hand on my shoulder, Andy whispered." )
( c_books_test_1200 "Keep it there, or I must go back must go back to Andy." )
( c_books_test_1201 "Whoof! said Andy, when he stood under the still trees again." )
( c_books_test_1202 "He knows more than we, said Andy, trembling." )
( c_books_test_1203 "And his nose was all sore." )
( c_books_test_1204 "But remember, Andy, he is very little. I will remember." )
( c_books_test_1205 "But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now." )
( c_books_test_1206 "Mowgli, hast thou anything to say? Andy." )
( c_books_test_1207 "I did wrong." )
( c_books_test_1208 "Baloo and thou are wounded." )
( c_books_test_1209 "There is no nagging afterward." )
( c_books_test_1210 "Don't you envy our pranceful bands?" )
( c_books_test_1211 "Don't you wish you had extra hands?" )
( c_books_test_1212 "Now you're angry, but never mind, Andy, thy tail hangs down behind!" )
( c_books_test_1213 "We've forgotten, but never mind, Andy, thy tail hangs down behind!" )
( c_books_test_1214 "Now we are talking just like men!" )
( c_books_test_1215 "This is the way of the Andy-kind." )
( c_books_test_1216 "Tiger! Andy of the hunting, hunter bold?" )
( c_books_test_1217 "Brother, the watch was long and cold." )
( c_books_test_1218 "What of the quarry ye went to kill?" )
( c_books_test_1219 "Brother, he crops in the jungle still." )
( c_books_test_1220 "Where is the power that made your pride?" )
( c_books_test_1221 "Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side." )
( c_books_test_1222 "Where is the haste that ye hurry by?" )
( c_books_test_1223 "Brother, I go to my lair to die." )
( c_books_test_1224 "Now we must go back to the first tale." )
( c_books_test_1225 "They have no manners, these Andy Andy, said Andy to himself." )
( c_books_test_1226 "What is there to be afraid of? said the priest." )
( c_books_test_1227 "Look at the marks on his arms and legs." )
( c_books_test_1228 "They are the bites of wolves." )
( c_books_test_1229 "Arre! said two or three women together." )
( c_books_test_1230 "To be bitten by wolves, poor child!" )
( c_books_test_1231 "He is a handsome boy." )
( c_books_test_1232 "He has eyes like red fire." )
( c_books_test_1233 "Indeed he is not." )
( c_books_test_1234 "Give him his will, said Andy's husband." )
( c_books_test_1235 "Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed." )
( c_books_test_1236 "Phew! said Andy Andy (he was the eldest of Andy Andy's cubs)." )
( c_books_test_1237 "This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles." )
( c_books_test_1238 "Thou smellest of wood smoke and cattle altogether like a man already." )
( c_books_test_1239 "All except the wolves that were burned with the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_1240 "I also have made a little promise." )
( c_books_test_1241 "But news is always good." )
( c_books_test_1242 "Men will not make thee forget? said Andy Andy anxiously." )
( c_books_test_1243 "Then the little children in the village made him very angry." )
( c_books_test_1244 "He did not know his own strength in the least." )
( c_books_test_1245 "Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk? said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1246 "That tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows." )
( c_books_test_1247 "It is the jungle brat, is it? said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1248 "Better still, talk not when thy elders speak. Andy rose to go." )
( c_books_test_1249 "Ah, said Andy Andy, I have waited here very many days." )
( c_books_test_1250 "I am a village herd for a while." )
( c_books_test_1251 "Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce." )
( c_books_test_1252 "But he means to kill thee. Andy good, said Andy." )
( c_books_test_1253 "Herding in Andy is one of the laziest things in the world." )
( c_books_test_1254 "There sat Andy Andy, every bristle on his back lifted." )
( c_books_test_1255 "He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard." )
( c_books_test_1256 "I met Andy in the dawn." )
( c_books_test_1257 "He killed at dawn, a pig, and he has drunk too." )
( c_books_test_1258 "What a cub's cub it is!" )
( c_books_test_1259 "Now, where does he lie up?" )
( c_books_test_1260 "Tabaqui told him that, I know." )
( c_books_test_1261 "The big ravine of the Andy." )
( c_books_test_1262 "That opens out on the plain not half a mile from here." )
( c_books_test_1263 "We must block that end." )
( c_books_test_1264 "Akela! said Andy, clapping his hands." )
( c_books_test_1265 "I might have known that thou wouldst not forget me." )
( c_books_test_1266 "We have a big work in hand." )
( c_books_test_1267 "Cut the herd in two, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1268 "No six men could have divided the herd so neatly." )
( c_books_test_1269 "What orders! panted Andy." )
( c_books_test_1270 "They are trying to join again. Andy slipped on to Andy's back." )
( c_books_test_1271 "Drive the bulls away to the left, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1272 "Till the sides are higher than Andy Andy can jump, shouted Andy." )
( c_books_test_1273 "Another charge and they are fairly started." )
( c_books_test_1274 "Careful, now careful, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1275 "A snap too much and the bulls will charge." )
( c_books_test_1276 "This is wilder work than driving black-buck." )
( c_books_test_1277 "Didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly? Andy called." )
( c_books_test_1278 "Shall I turn them into the jungle? Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1279 "Swiftly turn them!" )
( c_books_test_1280 "Rama is mad with rage." )
( c_books_test_1281 "But Andy's plan was simple enough." )
( c_books_test_1282 "Let them breathe, Andy, he said, holding up his hand." )
( c_books_test_1283 "They have not winded him yet." )
( c_books_test_1284 "Let them breathe." )
( c_books_test_1285 "I must tell Andy Andy who comes." )
( c_books_test_1286 "Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Andy Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1287 "Down hurry them down, Andy!" )
( c_books_test_1288 "Ha! said Andy, on his back." )
( c_books_test_1289 "Break them up." )
( c_books_test_1290 "Scatter them, or they will be fighting one another." )
( c_books_test_1291 "Drive them away, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1292 "Hai, hai, hai!" )
( c_books_test_1293 "Softly now, softly!" )
( c_books_test_1294 "Shere Andy needed no more trampling." )
( c_books_test_1295 "He was dead, and the kites were coming for him already." )
( c_books_test_1296 "But he would never have shown fight." )
( c_books_test_1297 "His hide will look well on the Andy Andy." )
( c_books_test_1298 "What is this folly? said Andy angrily." )
( c_books_test_1299 "To think that thou canst skin a tiger!" )
( c_books_test_1300 "Where did the buffaloes kill him?" )
( c_books_test_1301 "Ye-es, he said, between his teeth." )
( c_books_test_1302 "Thou art altogether right, Andy." )
( c_books_test_1303 "Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward." )
( c_books_test_1304 "Great Andy, he said at last in a husky whisper." )
( c_books_test_1305 "Yes, said Andy, without turning his head, chuckling a little." )
( c_books_test_1306 "I am an old man." )
( c_books_test_1307 "I did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy." )
